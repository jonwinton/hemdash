All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href=\"http://netsparker.com\">Netsparker</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/\">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site.

One trend, started as a way to break free of the constraints of traditional WordPress theming, is using a decoupled architecture to customize the frontend.</p>\n<p>There are certainly pros and cons to this method, and this post aims to examine the various reasons why some frontend developers are implementing a headless WordPress.</p>\n<h2>What Is Decoupled WordPress?</h2>\n<p>Decoupled WordPress is the separation of the backend from the frontend. WordPress is traditionally monolithic, giving you the dashboard, plugins and themes all-in-one. Many developers have been playing around with decoupled builds lately with the primary motivation of creating a better user experience.</p>\n<p>Decoupling allows you to experiment with different JavaScript frameworks, such as Angular, to build a truly custom experience for users. That’s not to say everyone should go headless, but rather that decoupling is an option if your project has a set of requirements that call for a more flexible build.</p>\n<p>In these cases, decoupling allows WordPress to do what it does best, content organization and editing while avoiding a lot of the complex custom code that goes into developing for a set CMS.</p>\n<h2>Why Are Developers Adopting It for the Frontend?</h2>\n<p>Translating modern design into a tightly coupled CMS can be tricky, so separating the UX layer of a site allows developers to leverage the tools they want, making the frontend truly agile and the end-user experience more friendly.</p>\n<p>For the right use case it’s a win-win situation. Use the best tools for frontend development, while making the WordPress authoring experience even better to empower everyone! Quite a few developers have mentioned that decoupled projects renew their love for a chosen CMS, and that the flexibility makes it fun to work with again.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of a decoupled architecture is the upgrade process. A headless build simplifies future updates by not requiring a CMS upgrade, ultimately saving a great deal of time and money come redesign. Frontend developers can now work at their own pace, independent of the CMS’s timeline, and focus on the best language for the task at hand.</p>\n<p>A good case study of a decoupled WordPress build is <a href=\"http://www.pixotech.com/\">Pixo Tech’s</a> project with the University of Illinois. They chose the best frontend tools for the job, understanding that frontend developers and CMS developers are not necessarily one in the same. For the nitty-gritty of the project, <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/what-know-about-decoupled-cms-recording\">check out this webinar. </a></p>\n<h2>What’s the Catch?</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, although a decoupled architecture may sound like that captivating and challenging project we’ve all been waiting for, it still has its pitfalls and is probably not the route for every project.</p>\n<p>Decoupling WordPress is a more customized, complex build that could mean more time and money up front, although cost-effective in the long run. It also means losing the content previews, easy string translations and UI oriented plugins and themes we’re used to in a coupled architecture.</p>\n<p>Additionally, decoupled WordPress is still a young concept, and best practices are still emerging. There’s no set way to do it, and you certainly won’t find a how-to tailored to your specific needs.</p>\n<h2>How Would You Approach a Decoupled Build?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API\">WP REST API</a> is a great way to facilitate a decoupled build—you can download it and then decide how much of your site you want to separate. Integrated into core and available to all WordPress users, the plugin provides an easy-to-use REST API, available via HTTP.</p>\n<p>This gives developers a great deal of flexibility for creating applications that use a WordPress backend and brings WordPress one step closer to being a complete application framework.</p>\n<h2>What Now?</h2>\n<p>Decoupled CMS is still a new concept, and as a community it is important to share our methods and what we learn as we continue to experiment with such projects, ultimately standardizing on best practices for the future.The possibilities for decoupled are endless, and it’s up to the open-source community to lead the charge and document what we learn.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 21:15:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 Adds Statistical Insights\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47740\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-version-5-4-adds-statistical-insights\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2285:\"<p>WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&uo=6&at=&ct=\">available on the app store</a> and includes a couple of new features.

They try harder. <img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> One thing they do that&#8217;s pretty cool is sell  decent cables, USB wall chargers, and car chargers for a cheap price right at the check-in desk.

I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a money maker, otherwise the only reasonable thing to do would be provide <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI\">a smartphone mount</a> (or have one already set up in the car) rather than saddling people with an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/559938/ref=zg_b_bs_559938_1\">archaic, non-networked navigation device</a> that has no idea about construction or traffic.</p>\n<p>I ended up going to a Walmart that was nearby to pick up a car mount (price, $12) that ended up being a life-saver for the trip. <strong>I also believe that every person in tech should visit Walmart at least once a year, and spend time in their technology section.</strong> It&#8217;s good to understand and see how people who don&#8217;t live for technology every day interact with it.

It is well-known for its many excellent medical and educational facilities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of the Sciences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With over 1,200 daily inbound and outbound flights, Philadelphia is easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The average hotel room and cost of living, is far below any other major East Coast city, and nowhere else has cheesesteaks like we do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#8217;ve yet to visit Philadelphia but one thing I&#8217;ve learned is that residents take their reputation for cheesesteaks seriously.

Although most of the confirmed speakers work with WordPress, ThemeConf is not dedicated to it, &#8220;It&#8217;s geared to those making themes in general and working on the front end.

The £49 tickets are for speaker sessions only while the £99 tickets include access to a workshop on using the REST API and lunch.

This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve heard this advice but it&#8217;s becoming more prevalent. I generally hear this advice from those who are living comfortably, have two kids or more, and/or have gone through the startup process more than once.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a distributed worker who receives a check every two weeks. I&#8217;m married, have no kids, and write about WordPress for a living. Putting family first should be easy but it&#8217;s not. The last two years as a distributed worker, I&#8217;ve put work before family unless it&#8217;s an emergency.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, my wife and I had a serious conversation about the way I work and how it has negatively impacted our marriage. I&#8217;m a late owl and on most nights, my wife sleeps alone. As a distributed worker, I get to make the rules and put myself in the best environment to get the job done.</p>\n<p>The conversation with my wife involved words not fit for reproduction but everything she said was right. I&#8217;m spending too much time on digital devices and not enough with her. Our conversation was the wake up call I didn&#8217;t know I needed.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy putting family first all the time. Some argue that you need to put yourself before family so that you can provide for them. Others find a critical balance between spending time with family and getting the job done.</p>\n<p>How do you put family first when there are bills that need to be paid, sites to be built, and a constant deluge of work to be done? Please share your thoughts, experiences, and advice in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Aug 2015 01:43:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.2.4 Patches Six Security Vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47605\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2004:\"<p>WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/\">4.2.4 is available</a> and patches six security vulnerabilities.

Unlike WordCamps, plugins, themes, and WordPress in general were rarely mentioned. Instead, sessions included high level topics such as, how to land enterprise clients, knowing when to move on to the next big thing, and the benefits of partnerships.</p>\n<p>The venue was perfect with plenty of space and the WiFi worked well. Lunch was an hour-long and provided on both days. The lunchroom can easily seat 300 people or more. Only a third of the space was used when attendees ate lunch providing a great environment to network with people.</p>\n<h2>Nancy Lyons and Technology&#8217;s Dirty Little Secret</h2>\n<p>Since I don&#8217;t deal with clients or own an agency, many of the sessions at Prestige are non-applicable to my day job. However, there is one session in particular that resonated with me. <a href=\"http://www.nancylyons.com/\">Nancy Lyons</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.clockwork.net/\">Clockwork</a>, shared her philosophies on hiring and getting employees engaged. Happy employees do good work but what makes them happy?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autonomy:  Control over time, technique, team, or task.</li>\n<li>Mastery: Make progress and get better.</li>\n<li>Purpose: Be part of something bigger.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of the tips shared by Lyons are geared towards employers but they&#8217;re just as applicable to employees. The biggest danger to agencies and freelancers is the inability to have conversations with clients about what is and isn&#8217;t possible. According to Lyons, you can love someone and still tell them what they need to hear. One of the best tips she shared is to find and have fun at work as there&#8217;s nothing wrong with having fun.</p>\n<h2>Behind the Scenes of the Livestream</h2>\n<p>Prestige is <a href=\"http://prestigeconf.com/free-livestream-minneapolis-2015/\">known for having</a> a high quality livestream where more than 1,000 people can watch the conference live. The livestream is produced by <a href=\"http://pixpromedia.com/\">PixProMedia</a>. The gentleman in charge uses a TriCaster to switch between speakers and slides during sessions. Here are a couple of photographs of his equipment.</p>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses#gallery-47580-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<p>According to some viewers, watching the livestream was like being at the conference but is not a substitute for face-to-face interactions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> The learning is like being there.

Their office was perfect for an after party as it includes, a foosball table, Nintendo Wii, shuffleboard, drinks, pool table, and small offices for private conversations. It&#8217;s one of the best after parties for a conference that I&#8217;ve attended.</p>\n<h2>Prestige is Serious Business</h2>\n<p>It may seem like a WordPress conference on the surface but Prestige is geared towards business minded people. It&#8217;s highly focused and filled with information you can apply to companies in and outside of WordPress. If you want to learn how to take your business to the next level, Prestige is an excellent value.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Aug 2015 20:40:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: How to Avoid This Embarrassing Sharing Bug on WordPress.com\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47476\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-avoid-embarrassing-sharing-bug-on-wordpress-com\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1804:\"<p>If you use the sharing feature on WordPress.com, you may have noticed an anomaly between your post title and what&#8217;s shared to social services.

The plugin was created to provide a Disqus alternative with faster loading and submitting for comments.</p>\n<p>Epoch&#8217;s creators set an ambitious goal for themselves on the plugin&#8217;s description page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The goal: To provide a realtime commenting/chat experience using fully native comments while being compatible with page caching, CDNs, mobile, other comment plugins, and SEO best practices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The plugin submits comments via AJAX, which means that comments appear instantly within the conversation without refreshing the page. The experience is designed to be so fast that it blurs the line between commenting and chatting, as comments from other readers also show up automatically with the same speed. The video below shows the plugin in action and a <a href=\"https://gopostmatic.com/epoch/#reply-title\" target=\"_blank\">live demo of Epoch</a> is available on the Postmatic website.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Epoch <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/changelog/\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.0</a> boasts compatibility with virtually any WordPress theme. The plugin will attempt to integrate with your theme via one of three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first tries to continue using your existing comment template while still offering all the performance gains</li>\n<li>The second overrides your comment template but inherits typography and colors from your theme</li>\n<li>The third totally replaces your comment template à la Disqus or Jetpack Comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/epoch-theme-integration.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/epoch-theme-integration.png?resize=1025%2C839\" alt=\"epoch-theme-integration\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47442\" /></a></p>\n<p>Unlike Postmatic, which has a <a href=\"https://gopostmatic.com/premium/\" target=\"_blank\">commercial option</a> for additional features, founder Jason Lemieux says Epoch will not be directly monetized.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not have any plans to create a commercial version,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Postmatic is our primary product, Epoch exists only to make it easier for people to move back to native commenting, and in turn to use Postmatic. Epoch will be free forever.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Compatibility with Other Comment Plugins</h3>\n<p>Epoch works seamlessly with Postmatic, i.e. it will pop up an opt-in modal allowing the commenter to subscribe to new post notifications. Using Postmatic in combination with Epoch is not required, because the plugin was created to work well on its own. It&#8217;s also compatible with many other plugins that extend comments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other third party native commenting plugins have taken a heavy-handed approach and do not support the comment template hooks built into WordPress,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;This creates a walled garden in which the innovation and hard work present in existing and future comment plugins is left out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We decided to take a different approach. We built Epoch to be compatible with other comment plugins as much as possible. Not all are, but with little tweaks here and there they work just fine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 integrates perfectly out of the box with Postmatic, WordPress Zero Spam, Akismet, WP Markdown, and WordPress Social Login.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/epoch-plugin-compatibility.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/epoch-plugin-compatibility.png?resize=1025%2C583\" alt=\"epoch-plugin-compatibility\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47447\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;In our testing most anything that does not use a lot of JavaScript works just fine,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;Things I haven&#8217;t tested but I assume would work would be anything that modifies or adds fields to the comment form (Subscribe to Comments, CommentLuv, various captchas).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fancier plugins that allow for comment editing or sorting the comment order based on voting would probably not be happy. We will have to make that functionality ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Epoch is a Disqus Alternative with an Emphasis on Privacy</h3>\n<p>When Lemieux and his team created Epoch, the strategy was to address problems with native commenting in order to pave the way for more users to get on board with Postmatic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t set out with intentions of competing with Disqus,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However, a few months in it became clear that there are usually two reasons people were not using native comments, and we would need to address both if we wanted widespread adoption of Postmatic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first is that the comment templates that come with a huge majority of themes just plain stink. Theme developers hate dealing with them. It&#8217;s usually an afterthought. So the commenting experience suffers. It is slow, ugly, and not at all fun.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The second reason is that native commenting is extremely hard on the server. You can&#8217;t run native comments on a high traffic site. The server would buckle. A CDN won&#8217;t save you because the page content is constantly changing. For larger sites, native commenting is not even an option.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both of these problems are solved easily with solutions like Livefyre or Disqus, so they get installed. But it&#8217;s just selling your users down the river. Your data is not yours, ads start showing up on your site. Privacy is out the window. And really, the performance gains are minimal when the embedded comments still take 10 second to load because there is so much tracking JavaScript being queued up in the background.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In contrast, Epoch loads faster than third party solutions and is completely private. Your commenters&#8217; data is not farmed out and comments stay on your server.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first time someone can say this: running native WordPress commenting will actually increase your site performance,&#8221; Lemieux said.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s on the roadmap for the future of Epoch?</h3>\n<p>Lemieux and his team hope to attract a larger community around the project, which is <a href=\"https://github.com/postmatic/epoch\" target=\"_blank\">open to contribution on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We plan on aggressively recruiting others to join the project and we hope other developers will be inspired by what we have started,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are going to build out a small API to make it easier for other plugins to hook into some of the advanced functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And there are a few things that feel like they may be necessary: comment voting and a simple little like button which would be handy as a way to say, &#8216;I appreciate what you said, I do not have anything else to add.&#8217; I would love to integrate that with Postmatic. I often will get a comment in my inbox and I want to recognize the thought that went into it, but don&#8217;t feel like I have anything to add. A simple little +1 would do it nicely,&#8221; Lemieux said.</p>\n<p>The 1.0 release of Epoch is exciting news for those who have been dissatisfied with WordPress native comments but are hoping for a reason to return. The plugin is open source and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/\" target=\"_blank\">available for free on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 17:45:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: Yuuta: A Free Visual Diary Theme for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47303\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://wptavern.com/yuuta-a-free-visual-diary-theme-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4045:\"<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-proposal-on-trac-to-remove-post-formats-from-wordpress-core\" target=\"_blank\">a new proposal landed on trac</a>, advocating the removal of <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats\" target=\"_blank\">post formats</a> from core. Many believe that this feature would be better as a plugin, since it has received little improvement over the years and is not used by the majority of WordPress users.</p>\n<p>If the UI can be improved to be less confusing and theme support is standardized, post formats may have a chance at more widespread adoption. The feature is entirely dependent on theme support, as post formats are not enabled by default unless the theme author opts to include them. Many still do, which is why ripping them out of core in favor of a plugin would be a major undertaking.</p>\n<p>One of the most common use cases for post formats is a diary style WordPress theme. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yuuta/\" target=\"_blank\">Yuuta</a> is a relatively popular theme on WordPress.org that revolves entirely around post formats. In the past four months, it has been downloaded more than 7,000 times. Yuuta was created to serve as a visual diary and includes support for all nine of WordPress&#8217; post formats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yuuta.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yuuta.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"yuuta\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47392\" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme was designed by Felix Dorner, owner of <a href=\"http://drnr.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Studio DRNR</a>, a Berlin-based web development company. According to its description page, Yuuta was selected as the the theme&#8217;s name based on its Japanese meaning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yuuta is a Japanese name and is made up of 優 (yuu) “gentleness, superiority”, 悠 (yuu) “distant, leisurely” or 勇 (yuu) “brave” combined with 太 (ta) “thick, big”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Each post format has its own distinguishing icon and unique display. Dorner opted to use Roboto, Roboto Slab, and a sprinkling of Courier as the theme&#8217;s primary fonts. The typography choices were selected for optimal readability on all screen sizes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yuuta-chat-format.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yuuta-chat-format.jpg?resize=961%2C526\" alt=\"yuuta-chat-format\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47405\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yuuta also includes specific styles for both standard and Jetpack-enabled galleries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yuuta-jetpack-enabled-gallery.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yuuta-jetpack-enabled-gallery.jpg?resize=652%2C572\" alt=\"yuuta-jetpack-enabled-gallery\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47407\" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s design is fairly set, unless you opt to create a child theme. There are zero options in the Customizer. Much of the design customization is done on a post-by-post basis, as the featured image serves as a unique background for the post. Yuuta also includes editor styles to match the editing experience to the theme&#8217;s frontend appearance.</p>\n<p>The primary navigation menu is hidden until toggled into view by the icon in the header, which keeps the reader focused on the content. There are no sidebars to contend with but widgets can be added to the footer.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of post formats, the Yuuta theme really makes them shine. It responds to display beautifully on all devices from desktop to tablet to smartphone.

Since the API is not yet included in core, any theme or plugin author who wants to use it must have the feature plugin installed.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, WordPress.org themes are not allowed to require a plugin on installation (although they can suggest one). As per the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#plugins\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Handbook on plugins</a>: <em>A theme can recommend plugins but not include those plugins in the theme code.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;The core team has asked us to consider temporarily allowing the requirement of the REST API for themes that may take advantage of it,&#8221; Tammie Lister said before calling for a vote. She also noted that waiving the rule would be temporary, as the API will soon be going into core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This does not open up the way for others as an exception because it&#8217;s a core feature,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The team took a quick vote and all present unanimously agreed to allow themes to require the REST API plugin as a temporary measure until it is available in core. Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/07/28/theme-review-team-weekly-meeting-notes-the-logs-7/\" target=\"_blank\">meeting logs</a> for the full discussion.</p>\n<p>The WP REST API is already being used in production in many different ways around the web, as revealed in the comments on project leader Ryan McCue&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/rest-api-whos-using-this-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> calling for examples. If the Theme Review Team wants to keep pace with where WordPress is headed, it must offer the flexibility to allow for more innovative themes. Temporarily waiving the guideline against plugin requirements is a smart move.</p>\n<p>As WordPress.org accrues more examples of themes that use the REST API in a way that complies with the review team&#8217;s high standards, developers who are just getting started will have strong examples for creating their own. Jack Lenox&#8217;s presentation at WordCamp London this year highlighted a few of the benefits of theming with the REST API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides a way to retrieve pure data (usually in JSON or XML format) over HTTP</li>\n<li>No loops necessary</li>\n<li>Good for mobile apps and environments where you don’t want a full webpage to render but want content from a blog or site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the official directory now welcoming these types of themes, it won&#8217;t be long before the entire landscape of WordPress theme development changes to support more modern ways of presenting content.

Cory describes his approach to making friends and avoiding making enemies. You should also check out his recent <a href=\"http://corymiller.com/my-talk-on-mental-health-and-entrepreneurship-is-now-online/\">talk on mental health and entrepreneurship</a>, which is terrific.</em></p>\n<p>I’d rather wave a white flag and compromise than make an enemy. Every. Single. Day.</p>\n<p>I’ve purposefully and intentionally, throughout my life (and business), sought to <em>not</em> make enemies, but rather build friendships.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enemies are only trouble.</li>\n<li>Enemies are distractions.</li>\n<li>Enemies eat my time and energy and focus.</li>\n<li>Enemies seek your destruction.</li>\n<li>Enemies oppose you.</li>\n<li>Enemies seek to “harm or weaken” you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Friends do the opposite.</p>\n<p>My best example of this is my wife, Lindsey. I think of her as my greatest ally and my best friend. She’s the opposite of an enemy.</p>\n<p>The words I use to describe her are “caring,” “supportive,” “loving,” and “wants my best.”</p>\n<p>So why would I spend my time seeking to <em>create</em> enemies, instead of friendships?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can have opinions.</li>\n<li>You can take stands.</li>\n<li>You can and should draw boundary lines.</li>\n<li>You can have your principles and <em>never</em> budge on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>But,</em> you can also, simultaneously, choose to make and focus on friendships.</p>\n<p>Some of my best friendships have come through business, and some of them would be considered “competitors.”</p>\n<p>But I’ve cherished those friendships.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I sleep better at night knowing we only want each other’s best and that there is plenty of room for each other instead of someone actively, purposefully seeking my destruction.</p>\n<p>But instead of seeking to fester anger and hate and competition, I’ve sought the opposite, asking, &#8220;Where can we find ways to help each other do better for each other?&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what if we approached life and business like this:</p>\n<p>Instead of using that anger, bile, jerk-ness, and negative energy in telling the world who you hate and how big of a jerk you can be, and how you don’t want to be an enemy of &#8212; why not seek to build true, lasting, deep friendships?</p>\n<p>The old quote, “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,” is pure B.S.</p>\n<p>Why not create a friend instead of nurture an enemy?</p>\n<p>Why not tell the world that you can be the <em>best</em> friend they ever made? And prove it by your actions.</p>\n<p>Friendships do take an investment. They take consistency. They take time. They take compromise sometimes. It means showing up for them when they most need it.</p>\n<p>But those relationships have been some of the richest relationships I’ve ever had. And totally worth the investment (multiple times over and over in fact).</p>\n<p>And yes, I have made enemies in my life. Purposefully and sometimes not. In fact, someone recently asked me jokingly on Twitter who didn’t like me. I responded with:</p>\n<p>“I can think of 1 or 2 a-holes but I don’t like thinking about them. <img src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> hahahahaha”</p>\n<p>And although that’s sadly true, I’ve sought to minimize the enemies I’ve made in my life and business.</p>\n<p>My perspective on making necessary enemies is that <em>if</em> you <em>have</em> to make an enemy &#8212; and when I say that, I don’t mean because your personality defaults to that of a jerk and you sadistically like being labeled one), but you <em>have</em> to make an enemy because you have to set a boundary and tell someone no, or take a legal action &#8212; make dang sure it’s either for a <em>very</em> good purpose, value or strategic reason.</p>\n<p>And even then, question yourself about why.</p>\n<p>As my attorney told me recently: “You catch more flies with honey.”</p>\n<p>So don’t be a jerk while making enemies. You’ll make <em>more</em> enemies in the process.</p>\n<p>Simple, lip-biting kindness in the face of anger and hate and bile helps deflate a situation rather than pour lighter fluid on it.</p>\n<p>I tell people often: it doesn’t cost me anything to be nice and kind. (In fact most of the time it makes me happier.) And I seek out different avenues to vent my frustration and relieve my stress.</p>\n<p>So I say: Don’t make enemies. Invest in friendships.</p>\n<p>It should be common sense, but sometimes I (and maybe you) need a reminder.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 05:13:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Adler: A Unique Personal Blogging Theme for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47272\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"http://wptavern.com/adler-a-unique-personal-blogging-theme-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3395:\"<p>If you&#8217;re on the hunt for a new WordPress blogging theme but the designs are all starting to look too similar, you may want to check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/adler/\" target=\"_blank\">Adler</a>. It is one of the more unique themes to land in the WordPress.org directory in recent months with its uncommon typography choices and bright bursts of color.</p>\n<p>Adler was created by Romanian theme designer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BabBarDeL\" target=\"_blank\">George Olaru</a> of <a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixelgrade</a>. Olaru takes a unique approach to the popular fullscreen splash page style that many themes have adopted for a homepage layout, overlaying it with a serif font title paired with a hand-script style subtitle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/adler.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/adler.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"adler\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47315\" /></a></p>\n<p>Styling for single posts is similar to the home page with the featured image serving as a fullscreen background for the title. Scroll further down and the post content is centered with no distracting sidebar widgets.</p>\n<p>Adler combines two unusual Google font choices in the design: Droid Sans Mono for paragraph text and Permanent Marker for blockquotes and subtitles. Images in posts overhang the text column to create a strong visual impact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/adler-images-blockquotes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/adler-images-blockquotes.jpg?resize=810%2C812\" alt=\"adler-images-blockquotes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47318\" /></a></p>\n<p>Adler&#8217;s files include a tiny leaf icon that is tastefully applied on the home and archive templates to separate posts. The effect is minimalist without appearing to be stark. The theme also includes support for Font Awesome icons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/font-awesome.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/font-awesome.jpg?resize=656%2C534\" alt=\"font-awesome\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47320\" /></a></p>\n<p>The necessity for large featured images can sometimes be a drawback for users when selecting a blogging theme. After testing Adler, I found that the design doesn&#8217;t break if you don&#8217;t have a large featured image assigned to a post. In fact, posts lacking a featured image look just as nice as those that include one, so you&#8217;re not tied down to hunting for one every time you publish.</p>\n<p>Adler supports three menu locations for a primary, footer, and social menu. It includes support for one footer widget area, which spans three columns. There are just two options available in the native customizer that allow you to change the background color or add a background image.</p>\n<p>Adler was created to be a personal blogging theme and the design instantly communicates: &#8220;I have something to say.&#8221; Check out the <a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/demos/adler/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on Pixelgrade.com to see it in action.

In the case of a company or organization, a Slack admin can use the feature that permits anyone with an email from a specified domain to be accepted on signup. However, this feature isn&#8217;t applicable to teams that are made up of people with diverse email domains and associations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://boiteaweb.fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Julio Potier</a>, a French security consultant and prolific <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/juliobox/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin developer</a>, created a solution for this particular scenario. As an admin on the <a href=\"https://wordpressfr.slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPressFR.slack.com</a> team, which is open to all French WordPress users, he needed a more convenient way to allow new signups. The team has 27 channels and 250+ members with 200 added in the first week.</p>\n<p>Julio decided to create a plugin to make the invitation process easier in the future. The new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-invitation/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Lazy Invitation</a> plugin automates the sending of Slack team invitations by adding a frontend signup on your WordPress site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/join-slack-team.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/join-slack-team.png?resize=404%2C405\" alt=\"join-slack-team\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47285\" /></a></p>\n<p>The user simply enters an email address and the invitation is sent. A Slackbot confirmation will appear on the page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/slack-team-invite-sent.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/slack-team-invite-sent.png?resize=365%2C253\" alt=\"slack-team-invite-sent\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47286\" /></a></p>\n<p>To configure the plugin for your Slack team all you need to do is enter the group name and the security token for your Slack invitations. As this token is not easy to find, Julio wrote a bookmarklet that will automatically capture it for you. From the plugin&#8217;s settings page you can drag and drop the bookmarklet into your browser toolbar on the invitation page found at: <code>https://YOURGROUP.slack.com/admin/invites</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lazy-slack-settings.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lazy-slack-settings.png?resize=782%2C439\" alt=\"lazy-slack-settings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47295\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once the plugin is configured, the invitation signup page will be available at <code>example.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation</code>. If you&#8217;re using either the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recaptcha/\" target=\"_blank\">wp-reCaptcha</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-captcha/\" target=\"_blank\">google-captcha</a> plugins, Slack Lazy Invitation will automatically add protection to the form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/slack-invite-recaptcha.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/slack-invite-recaptcha.jpg?resize=350%2C481\" alt=\"slack-invite-recaptcha\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47292\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin also includes support for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sf-move-login/\" target=\"_blank\">SF Move Login</a> plugin, so that the invitation form is available at /slack-invitation instead of the much longer URL. This slug can be changed in the SF Move Login settings panel.</p>\n<p>In the future Julio plans to add support for adding invite pages for multiple groups. I tested <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-invitation/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Lazy Invitation</a> and found that it works exactly as advertised. If you have a large Slack team with open invites, this plugin will save you quite a bit of time.

Current extensions seem to focus primarily on adding multimedia features to the activity stream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/peepso-profile.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/peepso-profile.png?resize=1025%2C769\" alt=\"peepso-profile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47235\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Who is Behind PeepSo?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/merav-peepso.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/merav-peepso.jpg?resize=225%2C300\" alt=\"merav-peepso\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-47241\" /></a>PeepSo was founded by <a href=\"https://about.me/meravknafo\" target=\"_blank\">Merav Knafo</a>, owner of <a href=\"http://www.jomsocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JomSocial</a>, Joomla&#8217;s most popular social networking solution. Knafo, a veteran in the Joomla community, brings a unique perspective on the differences between the Joomla and WordPress markets for social networking software. As <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" target=\"_blank\">Joomla captures roughly 7% to WordPress&#8217; 60% of the CMS market share</a>, Knafo saw an opportunity to break into a larger market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a business owner, it’s my job to pay attention to trends in my industry and unfortunately, Joomla has been on a downward trend since 2009,&#8221; Knafo said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many of our JomSocial customers have asked us to &#8216;make JomSocial for WordPress,&#8217; because they wanted to switch to WordPress but there was nothing like JomSocial for WordPress. Finally, I could not ignore the trend nor the requests and decided to get into the WordPress market as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Knafo hopes to parlay her experience with JomSocial into her new venture with PeepSo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We stuck with Joomla for almost 10 years now and took JomSocial to a whole new level when we took over in 2013,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am very proud of what we’ve accomplished with JomSocial and super excited to implement all this experience and knowledge into PeepSo.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How PeepSo Got Started</h3>\n<p>The idea for PeepSo was incubating for a few years before Knafo had the opportunity to execute it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Brad Bihun used to be a customer of ours at <a href=\"http://www.ijoomla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iJoomla</a>, and then he switched to WordPress,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We happened to live very close to each other in Encinitas, California, so we met up and suggested I’d created &#8216;JomSocial for WordPress.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;At that time, I didn’t even own JomSocial and I was too busy with all the iJoomla products. Then a couple of years later, I acquired JomSocial and he approached me again, but once again, I was just too busy. A year and a half into JomSocial acquisition, when things got a lot smoother, I finally said yes, he introduced me to the <a href=\"http://spectromtech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SpectrOM</a> team, and we got started.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the plugin appears to be marketed as a direct competitor to BuddyPress, Knafo said that it wasn&#8217;t created specifically for that purpose but rather to give WordPress users a more robust array of options for building networks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously we felt there was a need for another product as an alternative to BuddyPress,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Leaving users with just one option is rarely a good idea, people like options.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don’t necessarily plan to take on BuddyPress, we just want to offer those who want an alternative, a product that is of high quality and that is being continuously developed. Ultimately, people will choose the solution that serves them best. We are just getting started, but we have big plans and an excellent track record doing this successfully with Joomla.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Differences Between PeepSo and BuddyPress</h3>\n<p>I asked Knafo what her team perceives to be the most notable differences between PeepSo and its more established competitor, based on what they found to be lacking in BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d say the look and feel is a lot more modern in PeepSo right off the bat with no special themes needed,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The features are more up-to-date with the latest and greatest features of big social networks, such as Facebook &#8211; from cover photos to &#8216;likes&#8217; and so on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BuddyPress core developers have opted to leave the aforementioned features to separate third-party plugins as opposed to packing them into core. With certain features, i.e. photos and videos, PeepSo does the same, except the add-ons are supported by PeepSo core developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;PeepSo is lightweight and allows you to only add features that you need, to keep it lightweight,&#8221; Knafo said. &#8220;PeepSo’s code is so beautiful it made our developers shed tears of joy when they first saw it &#8211; that said, I never looked at BuddyPress’s code, nor would I be able to tell whether it’s beautiful or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In terms of code differences, PeepSo&#8217;s development team cited what they believe to be a few major differences between their <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-plugins/peepso-core\" target=\"_blank\">codebase</a> and BuddyPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All object oriented &#8211; from the PHP to the Javascript</li>\n<li>Built with a templating engine similar to what you see in shopping cart systems. This allows use with virtually any theme.</li>\n<li>The JavaScript uses an extension mechanism, allowing add-ons to extend the abilities of the postbox.</li>\n<li>We made the database queries as optimized as possible to allow for greater scalability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;We have a track record creating and supporting a very large social networking application (JomSocial),&#8221; Knafo told the Tavern. &#8220;We know the ins and out of this business. We may be new to WordPress, but we are veterans when it comes to social networking applications.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Where is PeepSo Headed?</h3>\n<p>The PeepSo development team, guided by lead architect <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davejesch\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Jesch</a> of <a href=\"http://spectromtech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SpectrOM</a>, has an aggressive <a href=\"http://www.peepso.com/roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> for improving the plugin&#8217;s core and adding more features via commercial plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our main goal is to add more plugins to PeepSo, you can see our road map here. We’ll start with a chat plugin, custom profile fields and then groups, events, pages and so forth,&#8221; Knafo said. The team also hopes to partner with other developers who want to create PeepSo plugins.</p>\n<p>I asked her if the team plans to create a hosted PeepSo platform for community managers. Knafo said it isn&#8217;t totally out of the question but isn&#8217;t high on the priority list at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We tried to do this with JomSocial but we had a hard time finding the right hosting solution for it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That said, we are open to the idea, a bit down the road.&#8221;</p>\n<p>PeepSo is just getting started and has not yet attracted many customers. However, Knafo&#8217;s experience of successfully running an open source project for the past 10 years has given her the determination to break into a new and unfamiliar market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The sales have been as can be expected this early after the initial release, not too shabby to start with but we expect whole lot more sales as the WordPress users become aware of PeepSo, download the free version and give it a try,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re here for the long haul and we take no shortcuts in doing this right. We know it’s a huge undertaking; there is so much more to do. I am confident that investing in WordPress was the right move, I’ve been very pleased by the feedback and the community. My hope is that WordPress developers will join us and create awesome plugins to take PeepSo to the next level.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 22:50:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Only 70 Tickets Remain to Livestream Prestige for Free August 1-2, 2015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47208\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"http://wptavern.com/only-70-tickets-remain-to-livestream-prestige-for-free-august-1-2-2015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4855:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PrestigeConfLogo.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-27630\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PrestigeConfLogo.png?resize=275%2C233\" alt=\"Prestige Conference Logo\" /></a>With just a few days remaining before <a href=\"http://prestigeconf.com/\">Prestige takes place</a>, there are only 70 tickets left to watch the event for free.

The first event was held in Minneapolis, MN, in October of 2014. Earlier this year, Prestige was held in Las Vegas, NV. This weekend marks the third time the conference will be held.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Prestige</h2>\n<p>The first and second conference had approximately 100 attendees and Doran expects the same amount this weekend. However, future iterations of Prestige will have lower attendance. &#8220;We are transitioning to more of an online event. We’re actually going to make the in-person events smaller moving forward.&#8221; Doran told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a chance the conference could morph into something completely different. &#8220;After organizing two WordCamps, I figured out some of the things I loved about them and some of the things I don&#8217;t. Prestige has given me the freedom to try new things and see what people like and what they don’t like,&#8221; Doran said.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PrestigeinVegas.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-47216 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PrestigeinVegas.jpg?resize=1025%2C576\" alt=\"Prestige in Las Vegas Nevada\" /></a>Prestige in Las Vegas, NV Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/prestige-conference-las-vegas-2015/\">James Dalman</a>\n<p>Although the conference has been held twice this year and in different cities, the organizing team plans to host at least one Prestige conference in Minneapolis every year. Talks are underway for the next event but details are not locked down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We plan to do one in Minneapolis every year because we love the community there. We’d like to do Minneapolis in the summer time, due to weather, then we’d like to do any winter events in a warm place,&#8221; Doran said.</p>\n<p>Organizing a conference is a challenging experience that benefits from having motivated organizers. Doran explains what motivates him to organize Prestige, sometimes twice a year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a small awesome team of organizers that love putting this event on. That and the people who come and share their knowledge. It’s a smaller event but to me, that&#8217;s the appeal of it. Everyone is far more approachable in this environment,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h2>A First for Prestige</h2>\n<p>This weekend&#8217;s event features a hands-on workshop by Jennifer Bourn of <a href=\"http://www.bourncreative.com/\">Bourn Creative</a>. It&#8217;s the first session in Prestige&#8217;s young history to involve hands-on exercises. The session is uncharted territory for the conference which has mostly focused on people sharing their experiences building  businesses.</p>\n<h2>How Long Will Doran Organize Prestige?</h2>\n<p>With this being his third conference, I asked Doran how long does he plan to continue organizing Prestige, &#8220;I’ll organize the conference as long as there is a demand for the content. People often say to scratch your own itch. This conference started off as a little self-serving in that I wanted to ask people all of these questions. Then I thought, couldn’t others benefit from this information as well?&#8221; he replied.</p>\n<h2>I&#8217;ll Be at Prestige Conference</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be among the 100 expected attendees at this weekends conference. If you&#8217;re attending the event, please stop me and say hi. If not, make sure you grab one of the <a href=\"http://prestigeconf.com/tickets/\">70 tickets left</a> to watch a livestream of the event.

WPUA originally launched in December 2010, with the goal of providing a central place for WordPress users to swap war stories, learn how to get the most out of WordPress, and take part in getting special discounts on themes and plugins.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WPUAFrontPage.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47197\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WPUAFrontPage.png?resize=1025%2C489\" alt=\"Redesigned Front Page\" /></a>Redesigned Front Page\n<p>Three years after its launch, the site appeared to be dead. In 2013, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/psa-dont-give-your-money-to-the-wpua\">I paid to become a member</a> to confirm my suspicions and to see if the site still accepted payments. Free themes and plugins offered to members were not impressive and there wasn&#8217;t much to choose from. All of the videos used for WordPress training were broken. Despite these setbacks, I was able to successfully complete the refund process.</p>\n<h2>Financial Details</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, WPUA.org was listed on <a href=\"https://flippa.com/\">Flippa.com</a>, a domain auctioning site. As part of the auction financial details of WPUA.org were made public. According to <a href=\"https://flippa.com/users/217895\">the seller</a>, the site made $20K when it launched. The previous owners spent between $500-$1,000 on ads and answering WordPress questions through the Ask a WordPress Expert section of the site.</p>\n<p>The following shows revenue, costs, and profit between October 2014 and March 2015. WPUA earned revenue primarily with product or service sales and affiliate income.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WPUARevenue.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47198\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WPUARevenue.png?resize=580%2C273\" alt=\"WPUA Revenue\" /></a>WPUA Revenue\n<p>At the time the site was listed for auction, it had 3,500+ total members made up of free and paid subscriptions. The site today boasts more than 5,600 members.</p>\n<h2>Previous Owner Explains Why He Sold The Site</h2>\n<p>Wesley Williams is the former owner of WPUA.org and helped launch the site in 2010. Williams transitioned away from the domain because his web development business used the majority of his time. &#8220;We felt with our limited time to invest in it that it was best to transition it to someone who shared our passion but had a little more time to invest in growing the community and serving the members. We completed this transition back in April,&#8221; Williams told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the WPUA was not a successful venture but Williams says otherwise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say it wasn&#8217;t a success. There are thousands of members and we provided a lot of help to a lot of new and experienced WordPress users. As my main core business grew and as the time requirements of our projects increased, we couldn&#8217;t devote the time required to answer questions and give the help needed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, WPUA was a big success in my mind. Just from a number of members point of view it was a success. From the amount and number of questions and people we helped it was a success and from a financial standpoint it was a success,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Williams explains his goal with WPUA and why some members of the community may not be aware of the growth it had. &#8220;My goal was to help the under-served, those just getting started and without the technical know how to make what is actually simple fixes or changes to their WordPress site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t run the WPUA in the circles of all the established WordPress technical crowd, even though a large number of them became members of the WPUA. I ran it focused on users new to the platform and so because of that, some members of the WordPress community might not be aware of the growth and success it had,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Through the course of time, Williams and his team adjusted membership levels and access points which helped increase registrations. Williams also learned that what members wanted was a direct way to ask questions and receive expert answers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A person new to the platform didn&#8217;t want to post their question in a forum and they weren&#8217;t really sure what the real question was. Thus, we removed the forum and went to an &#8216;Ask an Expert&#8217; system where they could email their questions. This seemed to work better for everyone,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Overall, Williams is happy with how WPUA progressed and feels fortunate to have played a role in its growth and success.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who is Paul DeMott?</strong></h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/129324627\">following video,</a> DeMott explains how to build a eCommerce site with WooCommerce and calls himself the new president of recruitment for the WPUA.

Shortly afterwards, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/search/4.2.3?forums=1\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org support forums</a> were flooded with reports of websites broken by the update.</p>\n<p>Roughly eight hours later Robert Chapin (@<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove/\" target=\"_blank\">miqrogroove</a>) published a post to the Make.WordPress.org/Core blog, detailing <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/changes-to-the-shortcode-api/\" target=\"_blank\">changes to the Shortcode API</a> that were included in the release. According to Chapin, these changes were necessary as part of the security fix:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to the nature of the fix – as is often the case with security fixes – we were unable to alert plugin authors ahead of time, however we did make efforts to scan the plugin directory for plugins that may have been affected.</p>\n<p>With this change, every effort has been made to preserve all of the core features of the Shortcode API. That said, there are some new limitations that affect some rare uses of shortcodes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The security team had no reasonable way of accounting for every single edge case, but the negative impact of these changes were far more wide-reaching than they had anticipated. This particular use case likely wasn&#8217;t covered in their testing. Unfortunately, plugin developers found out about the breaking changes only after the security release had already left a slew of broken websites in its wake.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I fully understand this is an issue, but isn’t this a weird way of updating &#8211; almost all our clients are calling / e-mailing us at the moment as their sites seem to be broken,&#8221; one developer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/changes-to-the-shortcode-api/#comment-26449\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the Shortcode API post. &#8220;Normally it would be better to announce such huge impact changes to the plugin and theme developers. This means I need to fully reschedule my agenda, which already is full during holiday season.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Comments on the WordPress.org post are full of developers scrambling to find a way to fix client websites. Many were disappointed that the total secrecy of the security team, which is necessary in situations like this, was not immediately followed up with a public post on the important changes to the Shortcode API. Meanwhile, the email inboxes of agencies and plugin developers are filling up with urgent messages from outraged clients.</p>\n<p>Developers want better communication from the those who are managing security releases. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helzer\" target=\"_blank\">Amir Helzer</a>, author of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/types/\" target=\"_blank\">Types</a> and <a href=\"http://wp-types.com/home/views-create-elegant-displays-for-your-content/\" target=\"_blank\">Views</a>, two plugins majorly affected by the release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/changes-to-the-shortcode-api/#comment-26447\" target=\"_blank\">sums up the thoughts of many other commenters</a> on the Make/WordPress.org/Core post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are updating the Views plugin today, so that we resolve all shortcodes before passing to WordPress to process content.</p>\n<p>This is a straightforward change, which takes us one day to complete.</p>\n<p>Would have been great to receive a heads-up about an upcoming change in WordPress, so we could do this change on time.</p>\n<p>We received a huge amount of support requests due to this, but this isn’t the issue. We can deal with a wave a support issues. This time it wasn’t “our fault”, but sometimes it is.</p>\n<p>What worries us, as mentioned above, is seeing our clients (folks who build WordPress sites for a living), losing their faith in the system. They feel like the system sees them as little ants and not as humans. People don’t like seeing their problems being dismissed.</p>\n<p>Many of them run hundreds of sites. They cannot afford to stop everything and fix content on so many sites. Especially not if they are currently away for their family vacation.</p>\n<p>What others have asked here, and I would like to ask, too, is to setup a mechanism that allows WordPress core developers to privately communicate such upcoming issues with plugins developers.</p>\n<p>We are your partners.</p>\n<p>Without WordPress (secure, stable and reliable), we would not exist.</p>\n<p>Without great themes and plugins, WordPress would not power 24% of the Web.</p>\n<p>WordPress core members already volunteer a lot of their time. I’m not asking for anyone to volunteer more time. Need help? Ask us. There is a huge community of developers who rely on WordPress. We would be happy to get involved and set up whatever is needed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>User confidence in WordPress&#8217; automatic background updates took a dent with the 4.2.3 release. Waking up to broken websites causes users to second guess automatic updates after being assured that maintenance and security releases would not include breaking changes.</p>\n<p>When users get burned by automatic updates, in the end it doesn&#8217;t matter which party is at fault &#8211; whether it&#8217;s the core team or a theme or plugin. They simply expect updates to work and not break anything. Even in instances where a poorly coded extension may be at fault, the average user has no way of determining whether or not their active plugins follow WordPress best practices.</p>\n<p>The aftermath of the most recent security release is one reason why many developers and users are still wary of automatic updates. Amir Helzer represents many other plugin developers who are eager to find better ways to work together with the core team to provide a better update experience for users. This is especially important for releases like this one where the Shortcode API changes directly affected users&#8217; content. Hezler&#8217;s comment reaffirms the fact that development agencies, plugin developers, and core developers are all partners on the same team. It&#8217;s time to find better ways of working together to provide the best update experience possible for WordPress users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 02:46:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: FooPlugin’s Digital License Key Management Plugin is Now Open Source for Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47117\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"http://wptavern.com/fooplugins-digital-license-key-management-plugin-is-now-open-source-for-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5296:\"<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/open-source.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/open-source.jpg?resize=1024%2C514\" alt=\"photo credit: 16th st - (license)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-45884\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/79777096@N00/6866996865\">16th st</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Three years ago, <a href=\"http://fooplugins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FooPlugins</a> built <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/fooplugins/foolicensing\" target=\"_blank\">FooLicensing</a>, a digital license key management tool that enabled them to manage customers of their <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EDD</a>-powered commercial plugins store. Although EDD already offered a license creation and management extension, FooPlugins required more features than it had at that time and opted to build their own.</p>\n<p>As of today, FooLicensing is now open source and free for anyone to use, along with the associated EDD connector plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We love the community and wanted to give back,&#8221; FooPlugins co-founder Adam Warner said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know FooLicensing could be so much more but we just don&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to it alone. We are a small team and because of that we find ourselves with dozens of projects that could be so much more if only we had more time and people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open sourcing a project can change its trajectory if there&#8217;s enough interest and developers willing to contribute to improve it. Warner isn&#8217;t counting on that, however, and simply hopes other developers will find it useful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a leap of faith, but if it helps someone else get involved to help create an even more robust system, then great,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bonus if it helps someone build additional extensions to help others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>FooLicensing&#8217;s main features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View and manage the validated domains for your EDD license level</li>\n<li>One click EDD license upgrade/add to cart</li>\n<li>One click EDD license renewal (with associated discount) /add to cart</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A logged-in user who has entered a license key will see all the relevant account information detailing status, activations, expirations, etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/foolicensing-user-admin.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/foolicensing-user-admin.png?resize=580%2C332\" alt=\"foolicensing-user-admin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47135\" /></a></p>\n<p>Administrators who are using the plugin together with its <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/fooplugins/edd-foolicensing\" target=\"_blank\">EDD Connector</a> will see a menu with various license creation and management tools.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/foolicensing-admin-view.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/foolicensing-admin-view.png?resize=160%2C264\" alt=\"foolicensing-admin-view\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47137\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/fooplugins/edd-foolicensing\" target=\"_blank\">EDD Connector</a>, also now open source, enables the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add new licenses to attach to an EDD product</li>\n<li>A searchable list of all license keys that have been created and assigned, complete with attached domains</li>\n<li>A list of licenses that have been renewed</li>\n<li>Testing for license validation and update checks in the API Sandbox</li>\n<li>A management area for various messages (domain attach, detach) and for license renewal discount amount and emails</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Foo Licensing is Extensible for Other Platforms</h3>\n<p>FooLicensing was built from the beginning to be extensible for use with other platforms beyond EDD. The team at FooPlugins had plans to expand their library of connectors but didn&#8217;t have the time to execute them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal for FooLicensing was to build additional integrations for other eCommerce plugins and digital sales platforms but it quickly took a back seat as our <a href=\"https://fooplugins.com/plugins/foobox/\" target=\"_blank\">FooBox</a> and other plugins like <a href=\"https://fooplugins.com/plugins/foogallery/\" target=\"_blank\">FooGallery</a> gained popularity,&#8221; Warner said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Documentation is non-existent at this point, but we welcome you to step through the code and consider getting involved with the core plugin or with extensions for other eCommerce platforms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Warner said the team is considering a full-fledged site dedicated to FooLicensing if enough developers become interested and would consider the possibility of a marketplace to host any extension built. FooPlugins does not currently have plans to create additional extensions in house.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see what the future holds, but for now we need to move forward with some other things rather than holding this tight to our chests,&#8221; Warner said. &#8220;Open sourcing the plugins just fits in with what we believe is the right thing to do to make the web (and the WP community) a better place.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 20:17:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"Post Status: Thesis, Automattic, and WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=13692\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://poststatus.com/thesis-automattic-and-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70425:\"<p>Chris Pearson and Matt Mullenweg have hardly communicated with one another in the last five years, but they are ideological enemies. They are both wealthy individuals (though of different magnitudes) thanks to their online endeavors, with very strong personalities and unshakable beliefs on business and software. This is a story of their dispute, their idealism, and the implications it will have on the WordPress project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> co-founded WordPress, founded <a href=\"https://automattic.com\">Automattic</a>, and is one of the most successful entrepreneurs of his generation. He runs a billion dollar &#8220;unicorn&#8221; startup centered on a culture of embracing open source technology and has achieved incredible success embracing principles counterintuitive to either Silicon Valley or big corporate culture. He&#8217;s paving a new path for how to create a valuable software company while religiously defending and promoting open source software.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/\">Chris Pearson</a> founded <a href=\"http://diythemes.com/\">DIYthemes</a> and helped pioneer the early WordPress commercial theme industry. He has run his business successfully for over seven years, despite unique hurdles that result from a very public dispute with Mullenweg in 2010. He vehemently defends his work as his own non-derivative achievement and rejects the religiosity and cult mentality that he believes exists in the WordPress ecosystem. He views WordPress as a huge chunk of the web, available to be monetized &#8212; which he has done so to the tune of millions of dollars &#8212; but he does not believe he must adopt Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s principles in order to meet customer demand, run his own business, and protect his own inventions.</p>\n<p>By all normal definitions, Mullenweg and Pearson have done incredibly well for themselves. However, from a pure size perspective and principles aside, Mullenweg is the big nation army and Pearson is the small revolutionary militia. Mullenweg views Pearson as a threat to everything he stands for and has worked to accomplish, and Pearson views Mullenweg as an overbearing figure with no true authority over his decisions.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has the motivation, resources, and ability to squash Pearson &#8212; and indeed most thought he&#8217;d done so already. While he has far fewer resources, Pearson has some tools available to protect his business or to potentially even disrupt the entire WordPress ecosystem as we know it today.</p>\n<p>During their first conflict in 2010, and in the resurgent one going on now, Mullenweg and Pearson have both at times made mistakes, acted childishly, or been in the wrong. Both also have merit in various aspects of their positions. Neither conflict, so publicly debated, reflects well on the WordPress ecosystem as a whole &#8212; even though I believe it is right that each conflict is best observed under a public eye, as the results can affect so many other businesses and potentially even WordPress itself.</p>\n<p>With this post, I aim to outline the entire conflict; to describe the implications past, present and future; to highlight non-WordPress comparisons for precedent and potential implications; and to share my own thoughts on who is in the right and who is in the wrong, as viewed for the good of the global WordPress community.</p>\n<h2>A history of conflict</h2>\n<p>The commercial theme movement started in 2007 and took off in 2008. Thesis was one of the pioneers of commercial WordPress themes. The theme industry was young and evolving rapidly, and many sellers hardly considered or understood licensing issues at all.</p>\n<p>Many of the sources for this period are from Siobhan McKeown&#8217;s excellent account in the book, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/book\"><em>Milestones: The Story of WordPress</em></a> (which I&#8217;ll refer to as <em>Milestones</em>).</p>\n<h3>Themes as derivative works of WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress is licensed by the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later.

Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As WordPress co-founder Mike Little phrased it in the Post Status Slack, &#8220;The GPL is meant to be restrictive for developers and permissive for users.&#8221; The <a href=\"https://gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html\">GNU philosophy page</a> and subsequent articles are a good resource for understanding the nature of the license.</p>\n<p>The GPL is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft\">Copyleft</a> license, which creates the &#8220;stipulation that the same rights be preserved in derivative works down the line.&#8221; In an immature theme market, licensing was given relatively little notice, and many theme authors provided their themes with no license or proprietary licenses.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, to many, would be considered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life\">BDFL</a>, or Benevolent Dictator for Life, of WordPress. It&#8217;s a common term for folks that lead open source projects and have final say on project decisions. In his role as WordPress BDFL, he now has a reputation &#8212; at least within certain circles of folks that pay close attention &#8212; for making large, impactful decisions with little description of why he has done so.</p>\n<p>In late 2008, more than 200 free WordPress themes were removed from the WordPress.org theme repository. While many of the themes were removed due to spammy links, some were pulled due to GPL violations within the themes or within the theme upsells that were linked from the theme listings.</p>\n<p>The move, which was made without announcement, shocked many theme providers that felt they were unfairly included in the group of removed themes. The situation created a spark and initiated a serious debate about theme licensing.</p>\n<p>Authors were concerned that GPL licensed themes would mean that their themes would be bought and freely distributed, removing their ability to make money from their works. A few, such as Brian Gardner with his Revolution theme, <a href=\"http://www.blogherald.com/2008/10/01/brian-gardners-revolution-theme-goes-open-source/\">changed their licensing</a> as a result of conversations with Mullenweg and Toni Schneider, Automattic&#8217;s CEO at the time. In Brian&#8217;s case, he made his theme free and offered paid support services.</p>\n<p>Eventually though, most authors &#8220;selling&#8221; themes started actually selling support, access to download, and updates for their themes. This model was both GPL compatible, as well as workable for authors to get paid.</p>\n<p>In mid-2009, Matt Mullenweg also posted <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/\">on the official</a> WordPress blog that he was introducing a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/commercial/\">commercial theme listing page</a> on WordPress.org, and he shared an opinion he requested from the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), where they determined that the two themes packaged with WordPress were derivative works.</p>\n<p>The SFLC opinion did leave room for a &#8220;split license&#8221; where the WordPress and PHP code must inherit the GPL, and the CSS, Javascript, and images could be under a proprietary license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In conclusion, the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress’s copyrighted code. These themes, being collections of distinct works (images, CSS files, PHP files), need not be GPL-licensed as a whole. Rather, the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not. Third-party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that it might be possible to design a valid WordPress theme that avoids the factors that subject it to WordPress’s copyright, but such a theme would have to forgo almost all the WordPress functionality that makes the software useful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Split license&#8221; is the colloquial term the community has assigned to this statement, but in fact the actual splitting of which parts are GPL and which parts are not matters, so it may not do the reality of the situation justice. Perhaps it should be termed &#8220;PHPGPL&#8221; or &#8220;Non-Assets GPL&#8221;.</p>\n<p>A number of prominent theme sellers were unhappy with Mullenweg&#8217;s insistence that their themes maintain a 100% GPL license, but they were not willing to shake the boat over it. At this point, themes were becoming big businesses and making new millionaires (or close to it) of some of these shop owners. This settled the issue for nearly all theme sellers, and most moved to either 100% GPL or a PHPGPL license, and the doomsday scenarios never came; the theme industry continues to thrive.</p>\n<h3>Thesis holds out</h3>\n<p>But not everyone agreed to go either 100% GPL or PHPGPL license. Chris Pearson kept his Thesis theme under a proprietary license.</p>\n<p>Thesis was one of the most popular and flexible themes in the world, and Pearson <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/925d7dc6293b1662a7e6839a2703e8a858c730ad/Content/Part%205/39-thesis.md\">boasted on Andrew Warner&#8217;s Mixergy podcast</a> of revenues of $1.2 million+ over the 12-18 month period prior to the interview. Mullenweg and Pearson criticized one another publicly, and Warner invited them both to Mixergy where they debated the merits of GPL licensing.</p>\n<p>By most accounts, Mullenweg had the better argument on the Mixergy episode, and also came off as a calmer and more collected personality &#8212; in contrast to Pearson&#8217;s often heated, and sometimes very strange, statements.</p>\n<p>The debate continued between Mullenweg, Pearson, and a variety of WordPress community members and their blogs. Mullenweg was extremely aggressive, to the extent that he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/18548422506\">offered to buy</a> alternative commercial themes for users of Thesis that agreed to switch. Mullenweg tells me that many took him up on his offer, but it was, &#8220;less than a thousand.&#8221; In my opinion, this was a step too far by Mullenweg, though for him the issue was already personal.</p>\n<p>Pearson held his ground over the following days until an admission by one of his own team members of wholesale copying of code in Thesis from WordPress code, which violates the WordPress copyright.</p>\n<p>At this point, Pearson finally capitulated and announced that Thesis would be a split license GPL compatible theme, and the debate died down. Pearson put his head down and started working on Thesis 2.</p>\n<p>He released Thesis 2 in late 2012, and by this time the debate was cool &#8212; the community had moved on to other drama (yes, even more GPL drama) &#8212; and the release of Thesis 2 was largely ignored outside of DIYthemes&#8217; audience, which was quite large but also largely isolated from the WordPress &#8220;community&#8221; that cares about stuff like licensing.</p>\n<p>Therefore, not many people paid attention to the new Thesis or the licensing it contained. Mullenweg, however, was still paying attention.</p>\n<h2>The battle over thesis.com</h2>\n<p>If you consider the word <em>thesis</em>, what do you think of?</p>\n<p>If you are a regular person walking down the street, you probably think of the general concept for stating a theory, or perhaps you think of the long papers that university students write as part of their programs.</p>\n<p>If you are in the WordPress world, you may also consider the Thesis WordPress theme by DIYthemes.</p>\n<p>Good, single word domain names are hard to come by. Thesis.com, if you visit it now, redirects to the <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com\">ThemeShaper blog</a>. ThemeShaper is owned and operated by Automattic, and frequently posts articles about WordPress themes.</p>\n<p>ThemeShaper is not a dedicated commercial property, but it does link to Automattic&#8217;s primary website, and Automattic does make and sell WordPress themes.</p>\n<h3>Automattic buys thesis.com</h3>\n<p>Automattic hasn&#8217;t always owned <a href=\"http://thesis.com\">thesis.com</a>. Matt Mullenweg met a third party owner of the domain at a conference &#8212; a guy named Larry &#8212; and inquired about the domain by email in January of 2014. Chris Pearson had already attempted to purchase the domain from Larry, and did not agree to pay the $150,000 that Larry requested.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php\">According to Pearson&#8217;s accounts</a>, he and Larry had a few exchanges that stalled with Pearson unwilling to bid beyond $37,500 for the domain, and Larry sticking to $150,000. With a $100,000 offer on the table from Mullenweg, Larry gave Pearson an opportunity to buy the domain for $115,000, which he didn&#8217;t do &#8212; in part because he thought it too expensive, but also because he suspected Larry didn&#8217;t really have the offer from Mullenweg.</p>\n<p>As we now know, Larry did have the offer and Automattic became the owner of the thesis.com domain name.</p>\n<p>Pearson didn&#8217;t know that Mullenweg actually bought the domain until November of 2014, when he was notified by a friend that Mullenweg&#8217;s WordCamp San Francisco State of the Word Q&amp;A session included a section where Mullenweg noted that he owned the domain (more on that later).</p>\n<h3>Pearson attempts to force domain transfer</h3>\n<p>On April 9th, 2015, Pearson and his lawyers filed a UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy) complaint, which is a formal method for resolving domain disputes, recognized by ICANN. UDRP isn&#8217;t a formal government court, but serves as arbitration for domains due to the recognition by ICANN.</p>\n<p>There are many, many examples of UDRP complaints in regard to trademark infringement. There are a <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-02-25-en?routing_type=path\">number of criteria</a> that come into play that guide the UDRP panel&#8217;s decision making process.</p>\n<p>The three basic tenets that must be met are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>(i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and</p>\n<p>(ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and</p>\n<p>(iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The panel reviews the initial complaint (in this case, by Pearson) and gives the respondent (Automattic) an opportunity to respond. All correspondence is in writing and not in person. The panel has two weeks after everything has been submitted to reach a decision.</p>\n<p>In this case, which <a href=\"http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm\">is available publicly</a>, the panel denied Pearson&#8217;s complaint.</p>\n<p>Pearson&#8217;s complaint cited that he fulfilled each of the three criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By noting his trademark of the word &#8220;thesis&#8221;.</li>\n<li>By noting that Automattic was using the domain with a commercial interest (by redirecting it to ThemeShaper).</li>\n<li>By noting the bad faith clause by citing that Automattic, &#8220;purchased the disputed domain name to confuse and redirect customers and potential customers to Respondent’s competing webpage.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the response, Automattic did not contest Pearson&#8217;s trademark on the word <em>thesis</em>. However, Automattic also noted that the word is very generic, and also that ThemeShaper was not a commercial part of Automattic, but a &#8220;blogging site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For the bad faith argument, Automattic claimed that the redirect to ThemeShaper furthers their, &#8220;purpose in providing a blogging site,&#8221; and highlights that the intention for the domain is not as a commercial entity or one to be confused with Pearson&#8217;s trademark.</p>\n<h3>Automattic wins dispute</h3>\n<p>Automattic won the dispute against Pearson. As noted, the panel had two weeks to deliver the decision, and Automattic proposed a settlement with Pearson before the decision was handed down.</p>\n<p>Pearson was considering the settlement when the decision came a day before the two week deadline, which is apparently not a common occurrence. Had the decision not come early, Pearson may have saved himself some trouble, especially in regard to eliminating the <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qs=85115266\">trademark cancellation requests</a> by Automattic on <em>thesis</em> and related terms.</p>\n<p>In Pearson&#8217;s blog post, <a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php\">The Truth about Thesis.com</a>, he notes the general terms of the proposed settlement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic’s attorneys drafted the original settlement, which included the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automattic would keep thesis.com</li>\n<li>Automattic would withdraw the federal trademark cancellation request</li>\n<li>I would withdraw the UDRP</li>\n<li>Both parties would mutually release one another (agree not to sue over this issue in the future)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nothing in the original settlement addressed the trademark infringement, and since this was the reason I took action in the first place, I added a requirement that Automattic no longer infringe upon my mark (which would mean they stop forwarding the domain).</p>\n<p>At this point in the proceedings, I agreed to the settlement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, since the decision came early, the settlement was never binding. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Mullenweg commented to me that Pearson&#8217;s stated terms are actually not the terms of the settlement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the settlement Automattic offered Chris we agreed not to infringe his trademarks (which is the law, regardless of what the settlement said). He never asked us to change the redirect of thesis.com in the settlement, and if he asked after, we would have said no. There were no restrictions on thesis.com in the settlement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also said, &#8220;I wish he had reached out before litigating,&#8221; and noted that it would have &#8220;definitely&#8221; changed the outcome of the entire situation. Whether it truly would have is neither here nor there.</p>\n<h3>Possibility for appeal</h3>\n<p>The UDRP doesn&#8217;t have an official appeals process. Instead, they are willing to not make the changes that a ruling states, if indeed a domain transfer or other action is ordered, if the affected party files a suit in court within ten days of the ruling.</p>\n<p>In this case, Pearson did not file in a court within the given timeline, and since the ruling did not require a change in domain ownership, there is no further recourse with the UDRP. However, there is no time limit if Pearson wishes to file in court &#8212; but that is the only path remaining if he truly wants to go after the domain.</p>\n<h3>Legitimacy of the trademark dispute</h3>\n<p>Trademark law has a long history. Trademarks follow a categorical system, meaning words and terms must be trademarked within a particular category to be applied to.</p>\n<p>Pearson has three trademarks for the Thesis and DIYthemes brands, all under <a href=\"http://www.oppedahl.com/trademarks/tmclasses.htm\">international trademark class</a> 42, for computer, scientific, and legal purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>THESIS</li>\n<li>THESIS THEME</li>\n<li>DIYTHEMES</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The applications were filed in 2010 and registered in 2011. On June 16th, 2015, Automattic filed <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qs=85115266\">cancellation requests</a> for all three trademarks, which were instituted June 25th. Pearson has 40 days from the date the application was instituted (which would be August 4th) to file a response to the cancellation requests. His answers, &#8220;must contain admissions or denials of the allegations in the petition for cancellation, and may include available defenses and counterclaims.&#8221; It is his burden as the defendant to establish his defense, and, &#8220;Failure to file a timely answer may result in entry of default judgment and the cancellation of the registration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Basically, Automattic is holding his feet to the fire to defend the trademarks, which their counsel feels should not apply for two primary reasons, as listed in their <a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=1\">formal filing</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The trademarks were registered in Pearson&#8217;s own name, but are used by DIYthemes, and Automattic claims that, &#8220;The Pearson Applications were improperly filed in the name of an individual, who did not have the requisite intent-to-use the marks as of the filing date, and the underlying applications are void ab initio.&#8221; Their claim notes that US Code section <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1051\">1051(b)</a> offers this justification.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, section <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052\">1052(e)(1)</a> requires that a trademark not be &#8220;merely descriptive,&#8221; as Automattic claims his trademarks are.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If upheld, the trademarks will be deregistered by the US Patent Office, further limiting Pearson&#8217;s options to defend his claims to the thesis.com domain name in a formal court suit.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how good of a case Automattic has, but purely on the surface it looks pretty good. I spent time reviewing the application and the US Code and the arguments appear fairly sound &#8212; especially the argument that Pearson applied for the trademarks as an individual and utilizes them as DIYthemes, despite DIYthemes already having been registered as an LLC.</p>\n<h3>Automattic&#8217;s justification for the domain</h3>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/WmCl2kwS\">WordCamp San Francisco Q&amp;A</a>, Mullenweg noted the existence of the redirect of the domain name with a sense of pride, and a bit of a side-eyed smirk. In response to a question about relationships with commercial theme sellers and marketplaces, he states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>With the premium theme and plugin folks? &#8230; We have had some ups and downs, particularly with marketplaces that didn&#8217;t follow the GPL, for example, or violated WordPress&#8217;s license &#8212; themes that violated WordPress&#8217;s license. Um, you can go to thesis.com to learn more about that. Type it in, seriously.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was at this Q&amp;A in person, and don&#8217;t remember him saying this, as it was so buried in a much larger conversation, and I was simultaneously writing a wrap-up post about the State of the Word. However, once the UDRP ruling surfaced publicly, a number of WordPress community members recalled Matt&#8217;s statement and it brought a new dimension to the ruling and Mullenweg&#8217;s motivation for the domain.</p>\n<p>While Automattic bought the domain, Matt Mullenweg was clearly the driving force behind the decision. When <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks\">WP Tavern prompted Automattic</a> for a comment on their motivation for purchasing the domain, they responded with the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re happy the panel ruled in our favor. We think Thesis.com is a cool, generic .com that could be used for a variety of things. Just because you have a small WordPress theme doesn’t mean you have a right to seize generic English word .com domains.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We can accept Automattic&#8217;s case that they had a general interest in a generic .com domain, but in reality we know better. Mullenweg was clearly presented with an opportunity by this Larry character that checked all of the right boxes for him.</p>\n<p>He could get a domain he obviously knew Pearson would want, and deny him.</p>\n<p>It has a side benefit that it <em>is</em> a high quality generic domain that will likely maintain or increase its value. And he probably thought it was funny.</p>\n<p>I doubt Mullenweg even knew what kind of trademarks Pearson held, but despite Pearson holding the trademarks, it seems Automattic&#8217;s attorneys now have the upper hand, and it is highly unlikely Pearson will ever own the domain now.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks#comment-70849\">commented</a> on his refusal to give up the domain to Pearson on WP Tavern:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m not going to give a domain worth several hundred thousand dollars to the worst actor in the entire WP ecosystem, someone who keeps repeatedly violating the GPL and now has gone beyond that into patents. Why reward that? I wouldn’t sell it if he offered a million dollars.</p>\n<p>There are so many people doing amazing things in the WP community, and 100% GPL! I can and have supported them almost every opportunity I can, and one of the things I’m most proud of in the world is how many fantastic open source businesses have been built on top of WordPress.</p>\n<p>And it’s just the beginning — if you remembered in 2010 Chris said that going GPL would destroy businesses and sticking to the principles of our license would destroy investment in WordPress — we all know how that’s worked out since then.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Such a statement, combined with the WCSF video, highlights that the issue is about far more than the domain and its investment potential &#8212; a 10x return in less than a year would make for an excellent investment, in the near impossible situation Pearson would offer that.</p>\n<p>No, the move was quite clearly a personal one &#8212; if also convenient &#8212; for Mullenweg, and that&#8217;s why terms like &#8220;bully&#8221;, &#8220;petty&#8221;, and &#8220;spiteful&#8221; have been used by many WordPress community members surprised by his actions. They expected more. They expected better, even when directed toward someone as controversial as Chris Pearson.</p>\n<h2>Pearson&#8217;s patent</h2>\n<p>While a tantalizing story, the battle over thesis.com is not <em>the</em> story here. It has simply been the spark to reignite old disputes with new fervor with potentially much bigger consequences than the 2010 affair ever reached.</p>\n<p>One of two additional large components of this story is an active patent application by Pearson that was submitted in 2012 and published in 2014. Keep in mind &#8212; and Chris Pearson reiterated this to me many times &#8212; it is an application for a patent, not a published patent.</p>\n<h3>A patent on Thesis 2, or all web templates?</h3>\n<p>The main patent is titled, <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140095982A1/en?q=thesis&q=diythemes\"><em>Systems, Servers, and Methods for Managing Websites</em></a>. Chris Pearson is listed as the inventor and DIYthemes the assignee.</p>\n<p>The patent never mentions WordPress or WordPress themes, however both in the abstract and in the text, it does have many similarities to what one may expect as a description of a general template mechanism for a website, versus a specific description of the Thesis 2 technology.</p>\n<p>Here is the abstract in full (and here is the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/US20140095982-thesis-patent-app.pdf\">full patent application PDF</a>, including art):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Systems, servers, and methods for managing websites. Some embodiments provide methods which include, according to a user selection of a website skin, activating the selected skin. The skin comprises at least one structural box further comprising structural code for the website. The method also includes receiving a request (for instance a call to a hook) to serve the website. Further, the method includes, responsive to the request, outputting (by echoing PHP code if desired) the structural code with style related code applied thereto according to a reference between the box and a style package (which comprises the stylistic code). The outputting can occur in an order associated with the boxes. In some situations, another skin can be activated. Moreover, a change (or, perhaps, an edit) can be made to another skin and displayed without affecting the website. Moreover, another skin can be selected and associated with the website.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I discussed the patent at length with Chris Pearson, and while much of that conversation is off the record, I can share what I believe his motivations are with the patent application, and what I think the potential implications for this new chapter of Pearson versus Mullenweg are.</p>\n<h3>Discovery and publicity of the patent</h3>\n<p>This patent and another that&#8217;s since been rescinded were discovered by Automattic&#8217;s lawyers during the UDRP proceedings. There is debate as to how members of the WordPress community discovered the patents&#8217; existence &#8212; Jeff Chandler of WP Tavern and Carl Hancock of Gravity Forms were two of the first to discuss it publicly &#8212; but there is speculation from Chris Pearson and others that the community discovery of these patents was leaked by Mullenweg himself in order to deflect the attention at the time away from the domain issue and onto the patents and their potential implications.</p>\n<p>I honestly don&#8217;t care how they came up, though Pearson&#8217;s questioning of Jeff Chandler&#8217;s journalistic integrity were uncalled for. It is anyone&#8217;s right and ability to tip someone off to legitimate news &#8212; and these patent applications are legitimate news &#8212; and I don&#8217;t believe for a second that Chandler has played puppet to his boss&#8217;s wishes. He has dutifully and to the best of his ability written about whatever news matters to the community, and I respect him for it.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this patent does potentially have significantly more newsworthiness, depending on if it is approved and how it is defended by Pearson if it is approved.</p>\n<h3>Patent law and litigation</h3>\n<p>Patents often get a bad reputation, and their role in the software world is quite murky. I apologize in advance for this long sidebar on the wild world of patents.</p>\n<h4>Patent trolls</h4>\n<p>Most folks have heard of &#8220;patent trolls&#8221; that prey on companies using vague or overly generic patents, demanding big payouts.</p>\n<p>Patent law is weird, and the lawsuits that result are infamously unpredictable and cause a scenario ripe for abuse. For example, filing patent lawsuits in one district over another can have enormous impact, like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/business/24ward.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\">the case of Marshall, Texas</a>, which is a hotbed for patent trolls:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Patent litigation is a growing business across the country; Marshall is just the most visible example. Among the weightier issues behind the mushrooming of its patent docket is whether the elements that have made it expand — hungry plaintiffs’ lawyers, speedy judges and plaintiff-friendly juries — are encouraging an excess of expensive litigation that is actually stifling innovation.</p>\n<p>Some say yes. “A lot of the cases being filed in Marshall are by patent holding companies, or patent trolls, as they’re called, whose primary and only assets are patents,” Mr. Tyler said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Companies that deal in patents but do not utilize the patented technology are <a href=\"https://www.patentfreedom.com/about-npes/background/\">called non-practicing entities (NPEs)</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the concerns with Pearson&#8217;s patent would be if it were approved and he sold it to an NPE. It&#8217;s not uncommon for NPEs to acquire patents with the express purpose to enforce them:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finally, of course, some entities buy patents with the express purpose of licensing them aggressively. For instance, about 25% of “parent” NPEs tracked by PatentFreedom are enforcing only patents that they had acquired. Another 60% are asserting patents originally assigned to them, and the remaining 15% are asserting a blend of originally assigned and acquired patents. However, if we add in the more than 2,100 subsidiaries and affiliates of these entities and treat them all as standalone entities, we find that 19% of them are originally assignees, and 69% are acquirers, and 12% are blends.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the important variations in their origin and behavior, NPEs present a fundamentally different challenge than operating company patent assertions.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Software patents unpredictability and &#8220;obviousness&#8221;</h4>\n<p>The concept of software patents <em>at all</em> has been in dispute for a long time. Thousands have been awarded, but there are a handful of past court rulings that seem to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/part-II/chapter-10\">govern the US Patent and Trademark office&#8217;s interpretations</a> for making decisions when reviewing software patents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/01/when-is-an-invention-obvious/id=47709/\">Obviousness</a> is a key term in the patent world. Patent applicants aim to create &#8220;meaningful&#8221; patents, but &#8220;at a minimum you must have claims that embody patent eligible subject matter, demonstrate a useful invention, cover a novel invention and which are non-obvious in light of the prior art. Obviousness is typically the real hurdle to patentability, and unfortunately the law of obviousness can be quite subjective and difficult to understand. At times obviousness determinations almost seems arbitrary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Art&#8221; is the outlay of the invention by the applicant, and the invention&#8217;s ability to be patented depends on &#8220;prior art&#8221; not deeming the invention as obvious. Establishing non-obviousness for software has a contentious history. If it can be shown that, &#8220;any combination of prior art references that when put together would be the invention in question,&#8221; then the applicant is in trouble.</p>\n<p>But there is a great deal of potential for subjectivity from thousands of patent examiners:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Still, ever since the Supreme Court’s decision in KSR [<a href=\"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/04/29/ksr-the-5th-anniversary-one-supremely-obvious-mess/id=24456/\">reference</a>] there has been a great deal of subjectivity in the application of the law of obviousness, which is apparent if you look at the patents that issue, patents that are finally rejected and ultimately abandoned, and the patents the Federal Circuit ultimately finds to include obvious patent claims. There is little to no predictability at the edges.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>The Alice case</h4>\n<p>In my research, the <em>Alice case</em> came up many times as a pivotal case for helping to define the legitamacy of software patents. Martin Goetz is the holder of the first ever software patent, and has <a href=\"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/02/06/alice-v-cls-bank-is-a-victory-for-software-patents/id=54489/\">an excellent write-up on the importance of the Alice case</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have been asked for my opinion based my long history in the software industry and from my perspective as someone that has followed that controversial question “Is Software patentable”? That question first began to be publicly debated when I received the first software patent in 1968 for an invention on a new way of sorting data on a computer. Shortly thereafter a publication printed a page one headline “First Patent is Issued for Software, Full Implications Are Not Yet Known.”</p>\n<p>Forty five years later a variation of that question was again before the Supreme Court when it agreed to hear the appeal of the Alice v. CLS Bank case.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Goetz argues that the Alice case is a victory for software patents on both sides: that it helps true inventions gain patents (he and others assign a high standard to define &#8220;invention&#8221;), and it also helps prevent abuse of overly vague or non-inventive &#8220;obvious&#8221; patents to be denied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Alice v CLS Bank Supreme Court decision in June 2014 was a great victory for those that believe that inventors that use a digital computer to innovate can get a patent on their invention. It is also a victory for those people and organizations that recognize how the patent System has been abused for many years by trolls and others where there was no invention. Since the Supreme Court decision in June, thousands of patents that should never have been issued are now being deemed invalid by the US Courts and by the Patent Office.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Obviousness and invention for Pearson&#8217;s patent</h4>\n<p>This long and boring description of patents is necessary because Pearson&#8217;s patent application is still just an application, and it can be challenged, both by the patent reviewer, but also by third parties.</p>\n<p>As patent obviousness is &#8220;so unevenly applied,&#8221; there is some risk in not challenging Pearson&#8217;s patent, if a third party like Automattic (or a myriad of other web template providers) is worried about the potential implications of the patent. Although, the Alice case does seem &#8212; in my very amateur opinion &#8212; to offer better guidance to reject the patent based on a lack of true invention.</p>\n<h3>Pearson&#8217;s reasoning for a patent, and its likelihood for success</h3>\n<p>Patents are not cheap to apply for. The patent application Pearson submitted is 34 pages of art diagrams and text describing the inventiveness of Thesis 2, though Thesis 2 is not specifically named.</p>\n<p>I asked Pearson why he applied for the patent, which he did not want to share the specifics of his position due to the open nature of the application. I&#8217;ve racked my brain to try and determine the potential causes as well.</p>\n<p>There are only a couple of decent outcomes for Pearson with this patent application. The most likely, and not good outcome for him, is that he is denied the patent; and in this case he would have spent a great deal of money for nothing.</p>\n<p>In the event he does get the patent &#8212; or perhaps even before it is fully reviewed for approval &#8212; he could face a challenge from Automattic or other parties that may be concerned his invention&#8217;s description could apply more broadly than Thesis 2.</p>\n<p>If he gets the patent, and he survives a challenge, I see three ways he could theoretically use it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He can do nothing.</li>\n<li>He can sell it to the highest bidding NPE, which would be a dreadful outcome for any web entities that sell templates.</li>\n<li>He can keep it in his back pocket, in case someone threatens his business or his software license, wherein he can initiate a lawsuit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honestly, the whole patent route seems odd. I don&#8217;t love the idea of this patent being approved, because the application does seem overly broad toward all web templates to me, from the title to the meat of the application&#8217;s art. However, there are loads of patents in the world for incredibly silly things that have never really impacted a lot of folks&#8217; life; it&#8217;s just that it doesn&#8217;t mean a silly patent <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> become a problem. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/patent\">mountains of evidence</a> of patent holders causing havoc.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not much of a gambler, but if I had to gamble on this I&#8217;d put my money on this patent never being approved, and definitely never truly impacting the web or WordPress industry at scale.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think Pearson is a bad guy for wanting to patent his work. When I requested comment about the patents, he told me, &#8220;If I were ever to consider selling my business, things like trademarks and patents show up on the balance sheet and add to the bottom line,&#8221; but that he views them as, &#8220;one of many expensive, ridiculous options for bolstering one&#8217;s business,&#8221; versus a way to celebrate and protect his achievements as I previously characterized his intentions.</p>\n<h2>The GPL</h2>\n<p>Most agree that the GPL has not been well tested in court, though a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license\">software license</a> is a &#8220;legal instrument.&#8221; There is often confusion over whether a license is a contract or not.</p>\n<h3>License versus contract</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite <a href=\"http://softwarelawyer.blogspot.com/2008/01/jacobsen-v-katzer.html\">things I&#8217;ve read on this</a> is by former Adobe Associate General Counsel Robert Pierce:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A license is not a contract. This much I know.</p>\n<p>Rather, a license is a permission granted by one party to another allowing use of a property without fear of lawsuit brought by the granting party. A license does not include a return promise (i.e., consideration) from the licensee. So, as we all learned in law school, a license cannot be a contract under law. This is not to say that a license cannot be an element of a contract under which two parties trade promises, one of such promises being a license. This is commonly known as a &#8220;license agreement.&#8221; But a bald license, a one-way promise, is enforceable outside of contract law. It is something apart. It exists and is enforceable under property law doctrine.</p>\n<p>What makes things difficult is that the scope of a license&#8217;s grant, and the conditions and restrictions on the license (or all of them together) can make what is intended to be a one-way license look a lot like a contract. The precise wording used becomes critical.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The distinction can be significant because, &#8220;contracts are enforceable by contract law, whereas licenses are enforced under copyright law,&#8221; though even this rule depends on the jurisdiction where the matter is being discussed. His larger point is that a license is a one-way street, whereas a contract is agreed upon by both sides.</p>\n<h3>Spirit of the GPL</h3>\n<p>There is little debate that a &#8220;Split GPL&#8221; or &#8220;PHP GPL&#8221; license is perfectly GPL compatible, though Mullenweg doesn&#8217;t consider that the &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/e55a93f1056ffac8466944086b2c5104becab9c4/Content/Part%206/42-spirit-of-the-gpl.md\">spirit of the GPL</a>,&#8221; and companies like Envato&#8217;s ThemeForest and others have felt the consequences of not adopting 100% GPL licenses.</p>\n<p>From <em>Milestones</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While not everyone liked the fact that the WordPress project would only support 100% GPL products, most people had accepted it. Many, however, were taken by surprise, by a sudden flare-up around not just the legalities of the GPL, but the “spirit” of the license. In a 2008 interview, Jeff Chandler asks Matt about the spirit of the GPL. Matt says that the spirit of the GPL is about user empowerment, about the four freedoms: to use, distribute, modify, and distribute modifications of the software. Software distributed with these four freedoms is in the spirit of the GPL. WordPress was created and distributed in this spirit, giving users full freedom with regard to the software.</p>\n<p>The Software Freedom Law Center&#8217;s opinion &#8212; with regards to WordPress themes, however &#8212; gives developers a loophole, one that helps them achieve GPL compliance, but denies the same freedoms as WordPress. PHP in themes must be GPL, but the CSS, images, and JavaScript do not have to be GPL. This is how Thesis released with a split license &#8212; the PHP was GPL, while the rest of the code and files were proprietary. This split license ensures that the theme is GPL compliant yet it isn&#8217;t released under the same spirit as the GPL&#8217;s driving user-freedom ethos.</p>\n<p>The loophole may have kept theme sellers in line with the GPL, but WordPress.org didn&#8217;t support that approach. In a 2010 interview, Matt says “in the philosophy there are no loopholes: you’re either following the principles of it or you’re not, regardless of what the specific license of the language is.&#8221; Theme sellers that sell their themes with a 100% GPL license are supported by WordPress. Those that aren’t don’t get any support or promotion on WordPress.org or on official resources. This is also one of the WordCamp guidelines, introduced in 2010; that WordCamps should promote WordPress’ philosophies. If a speaker, volunteer, or organizer is distributing a WordPress product it needs to be 100% GPL, i.e., the CSS, JavaScript, and other assets need to be GPL, just like the PHP.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg believes that Thesis 2 is not only not in the spirit of the GPL, but flagrantly operates in total violation of it, as Thesis 2 carries a 100% proprietary license. Considering the implications for folks that make stuff compatible with the GPL, it&#8217;s little surprise that Mullenweg has taken the stance and actions he has toward Pearson.</p>\n<h3>Thesis 2 carries a proprietary license</h3>\n<p>Chris Pearson&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php#comment-1507962\">comment on his blog post</a> describes that the theme has always been a proprietary license, and he describes why it is okay to be such:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In October 2012, I released an all-new version of Thesis that carried the same name as the original (which had a split-GPL license), but that’s where the similarities stopped.</p>\n<p>The new Thesis is not a Theme—it is an operating system for templates and design. This system runs Skins and Boxes, which are similar to Themes and Plugins, but with a boatload of built-in efficiencies that Themes and Plugins cannot provide.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is worth noting the final paragraph of the SFLC&#8217;s opinion that Mullenweg has cited numerous times as justification against proprietary licenses <em>does</em> have a provision for avoiding WordPress&#8217;s copyright:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finally, we note that it might be possible to design a valid WordPress theme that avoids the factors that subject it to WordPress’s copyright, but such a theme would have to forgo almost all the WordPress functionality that makes the software useful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Pearson believes Thesis 2 is. But the GPL has rarely been tested in a proper court, and never from a WordPress perspective. The SFLC&#8217;s opinion is just that, for now, whether Mullenweg likes it or not.</p>\n<h3>The GPL in court</h3>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation maintains the copyright on the text of the GPL itself, and between the FSF and the SFLC, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Legal_status\">small number of lawsuits</a> have occurred, and a German court upheld the GPL as a &#8220;valid, legally binding&#8221; license, but most of these tests have occurred outside of the United States. From what I can tell, cases involving the GPL have largely settled outside of court when based in the United States, or were argued on whether the GPL was legally applied, like in the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group,_Inc._v._International_Business_Machines_Corp.#The_GPL_issue\">SCO vs IBM</a>, rather than whether the GPL was legally binding itself.</p>\n<p>In another case, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_v._International_Business_Machines_Corp.\">Wallace vs FSF</a>, Daniel Wallace compared the GPL to price fixing, as it required software to be free. The FSF won the case, as the judge cited, &#8220;The GPL encourages, rather than discourages, free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems, the benefits of which directly pass to consumers. These benefits include lower prices, better access and more innovation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A much <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/2893695/open-source-software/vmware-heading-to-court-over-gpl-violations.html\">newer case involving VMware</a> again tests the GPL. The Software Freedom Conservancy, &#8220;claims VMware is using the Linux kernel without respecting the terms of its copyright license, the GPL.&#8221; This case may offer a better precedent for WordPress and its derivative works, as it is centered on &#8220;module loading&#8221; in VMware, &#8220;with an insulating layer to allow its kernel to use unmodified Linux drivers.&#8221; The case gets murkier than that, as it may not have been as isolated as it was attempted, but the result could be decent precedent for similarly loading WordPress themes and plugins, in my opinion.</p>\n<h3>Limited guidance</h3>\n<p>Few lawyers want to be the first to test something in court. It&#8217;s easier to make a case when there are many cases before you to provide guidance. With the GPL, there is what&#8217;s called &#8220;limited guidance,&#8221; meaning that it&#8217;s untested, and therefore the outcome of a GPL case in the US could be very difficult to predict.</p>\n<p>If a lawsuit does occur, it could prove costly to all parties involved, and I think it&#8217;s clear that Pearson and Mullenweg both wish that litigation was not happening, though both of them maintain a bit of a &#8220;you started it&#8221; attitude.</p>\n<p>Without a formal court proceeding, which could last years, it&#8217;s going to be near impossible for Matt Mullenweg to fully prevent non-GPL compatible licenses to exist for WordPress themes and plugins. His best method to prevent it is to do what he&#8217;s done so far: make an example of bad offenders and cause anyone thinking of using a non-GPL compatible license to reconsider.</p>\n<h2>Are all WordPress themes derivative works?</h2>\n<p>A key question to whether themes and plugins must be GPL compatible licensed is whether the theme or plugin is a derivative of WordPress itself. If it is derivative, then it is under the umbrella of the GPL&#8217;s Copyleft nature.</p>\n<p>Folks disagree a good bit on how themes and plugins should be considered as derivative works, though most either agree with Mullenweg&#8217;s strict &#8220;spirit of the GPL&#8221; view, or at least have molded to avoid being an outcast.</p>\n<p>The strongest argument I&#8217;ve seen in favor of all themes being derivative of WordPress &#8212; no matter how much or little they rely on WordPress functionality &#8212; is from WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is a tendency to think that there are two things: WordPress, and the active theme. But they do not run separately. They run as one cohesive unit. They don’t even run in a sequential order. WordPress starts up, WordPress tells the theme to run its functions and register its hooks and filters, then WordPress runs some queries, then WordPress calls the appropriate theme PHP file, and then the theme hooks into the queried WordPress data and uses WordPress functions to display it, and then WordPress shuts down and finishes the request. On that simple view, it looks like a multi-layered sandwich. But the integration is even more amalgamated than the sandwich analogy suggests.</p>\n<p>Here is one important takeaway: <em>themes interact with WordPress (and WordPress with themes) the exact same way that WordPress interacts with itself</em>. Give that a second read, and then we’ll digest.</p>\n<p>The same core WordPress functions that themes use are used by WordPress itself. The same action/filter hook system that themes use is used by WordPress itself. Themes can thus disable core WordPress functionality, or modify WordPress core data. Not just take WordPress’ ultimate output and change it, but actually reach into the internals of WordPress and change those values before WordPress is finished working with them. If you were thinking that theme code is a separate work because it is contained in a separate file, also consider that many core WordPress files work the same way. They define functions, they use the WordPress hook system to insert themselves at various places in the code, they perform various functions on their own but also interact with the rest of WordPress, etc. No one would argue that these core files don’t have to be licensed under the GPL — but they operate in the same way that themes do!</p>\n<p>It isn’t correct to think of WordPress and a theme as separate entities. As far as the code is concerned, they form one functional unit. The theme code doesn’t sit “on top of” WordPress. It is within it, in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space. If you followed the code execution for Thesis as it jumped between WordPress core code and Thesis-specific code, you’d get a headache, because you’d be jumping back and forth literally hundreds of times. But that is an artificial distinction that you’d only be aware of based on which file contained a particular function. To the PHP parser, it is all one and the same. There isn’t WordPress core code and theme code. There is merely the resulting product, which parses as one code entity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jaquith&#8217;s argument that the theme and WordPress execute together to form a joint &#8220;modified work&#8221; is the key phrase, I believe. As he states, and I tend to agree, it does not matter that the files are separate or that they can be distributed independently; together, when executed, they are so intertwined that they become a single work.</p>\n<p>That said, the theme is clearly dependent on WordPress itself, which is another common justification that themes are derivative. Explaining this concept is simple: WordPress can be distributed without any theme but those that ship with it by default. But a distributed theme, like Thesis, must be <em>installed and activated using WordPress&#8217;s own schema for loading a template</em>, and cannot operate independently of WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What about the WordPress REST API?</h3>\n<p>Thus far, we&#8217;ve discussed the derivative nature of WordPress themes and plugins, which require they operate within the WordPress install. It is a different matter if we consider applications that consume data or interact with WordPress as an outside application.</p>\n<p>The WordPress REST API enables one to interact with or consume data from WordPress, while being wholly independent of the WordPress install. Jaquith makes a clear exception for a scenario like this (and also applies it to technologies like RSS and XML-RPC):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Something that interacts with these APIs sits entirely outside of WordPress. Google Reader doesn’t become part of WordPress by accessing your feed, and MarsEdit doesn’t become part of WordPress when you use it to publish a post on your WordPress blog. These are separate applications, running separately, on separate codebases. All they are doing is communicating. Applications that interact with WordPress this way are separate works, and the author can license them in any way they have authority to do so.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>The GNU&#8217;s take</h3>\n<p>The GNU agrees with Jaquith&#8217;s take. They provide <a>an FAQ</a> to answer, &#8220;&#8221;What is the difference between an &#8216;aggregate&#8217; and other kinds of &#8216;modified versions&#8217;?&#8221; The emphasis provided is my own:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An “aggregate” consists of a number of separate programs, distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media. The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program&#8217;s individual license would grant them.</p>\n<p><em>Where&#8217;s the line between two separate programs, and one program with two parts? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide</em>. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).</p>\n<p><em>If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are definitely combined in one program. If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means combining them into one program</em>.</p>\n<p>By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The GNU argument falls very much in line with Jaquith&#8217;s, though admits itself that judges must decide whether it&#8217;s the case, in the end.</p>\n<h3>The case against The GNU position on derivative works</h3>\n<p>The University of Washington School of Law has a <a href=\"http://www.law.washington.edu/lta/swp/index.html\">section of their website</a> devoted to the, &#8220;business, legal and technical consequences of choosing Open Source Software (OSS) or proprietary software.&#8221; They cover many of the topics I&#8217;ve outlined in this post so far, and <a href=\"http://www.law.washington.edu/lta/swp/Law/derivative.html\">in the case of the GPL and derivative works</a>, they believe the GNU is overstepping with an &#8220;expansive definition&#8221; of derivative works with consequences, &#8220;counter to the goals of the proponents of Free Software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most compelling of multiple derivative works examples they provide is that of subclasses. For example, imagine a class, <code>Some_Theme_Class</code> that extends <code>Some_Core_WordPress_Class</code>. The GPL FAQ is very hardline on the topic (and for what it&#8217;s worth, Thesis 2 does extend some WordPress core classes). Washington believes the GNU stance on inheritance is too over-reaching:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Example 5: Programmer X wishes to write a class D, that is a subclass of existing class B. Class B is subject to the terms of the GPL. If X distributes D, does it have to be licensed under the terms of the GPL?</p>\n<p>The answer given in the GPL FAQ is short and to the point: &#8220;Subclassing is creating a derivative work.&#8221; In our example, this makes D a work derived from B, and thereby makes D subject to the terms of the GPL upon distribution. This approach attempts to further broaden the reach of the GPL, but it again leads to counter-intuitive results.</p>\n<p>Typical object oriented programming languages include a standard class hierarchy. This hierarchy provides a framework within which application developers can build their programs. The standard classes typically provide useful classes that represent user interface elements (e.g. windows, buttons, etc.), collection classes (for handling collections of data), and input-output abstractions (e.g. files and networking connections). In many object oriented languages, each class must be a subclass of exactly one superclass. And for this reason, the class hierarchies are rooted by a highly generic, standard class called Object. (The question of the superclass of Object is beyond the scope of this article.) The class Object describes only the most general properties and behaviors. For instance, in Java, the class Object only performs a handful of functions. In Java, every class is a subclass (directly or indirectly) of the Object class. Under the GPL approach, then, every program written in Java is a derived work of Object, because every program written in Java by definition consists of classes that inherit from the Object class.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whether this argument or any of the others Washington outlines would apply to WordPress themes and/or plugins would, again, need to be settled in court. But Washington does give a compelling argument.</p>\n<p>They conclude with the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In some ways, the apparent weaknesses in the GPL should come as no surprise, as the GPL was born of an era in which the central artifact of software development and distribution was the monolithic executable. In such a universe, software development proceeded principally by modifying the existing source text of programs, compiling source modules, linking the corresponding object files, and distributing the resulting executable. This model of software development and distribution has become increasingly fractured in an era characterized by highly dynamic, late binding, object- and network-based systems. The GPL, consequently, strains to cover these newly arising scenarios.</p>\n<p>To effectuate the goals of the free software movement, the drafters of the GPL urge a generally expansive definition of derivative work. The great irony is, of course, that such an expansive definition would have second order consequences that are exactly counter to the goals of the proponents of Free Software. A broad definition of derivative would give code authors less freedom to create software that they can truly call their own and do with as they please. And if naive analytic approaches such as &#8220;subclassing equals derivation&#8221; reign, then proprietary vendors such as Microsoft could arguably stake claim to every program ever written in C#, because they authored the original class hierarchy. And since it seems unlikely that courts would employ different standards depending on the goals or ideological motivations of licensors, proponents of free software might want to be careful what they wish for: what&#8217;s good for the GNU might not be good for the gander.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Aggressive license agreements</h3>\n<p>Both the GPL and DIYthemes&#8217; proprietary license could be appropriately identified as aggressive. The Copyleft nature of the GPL annoys many open source advocates, who would prefer a less restrictive license for developers, like the MIT or BSD licenses. The GPL is absolutely an opinionated license.</p>\n<p>Pearson&#8217;s proprietary license is also aggressive, in the other direction. I&#8217;ve never purchased a WordPress-centric product that so strongly forced me to accept a license. Usually, you have to look in the source code or a page on the website for a license; DIYthemes forces you to accept the <a href=\"http://diythemes.com/thesis/rtfm/software-extensions-license-agreement/\">terms of the proprietary license</a> before you can download the product at all.</p>\n<h3>Derivative works are not a bright line</h3>\n<p>The GNU attempts to offer a &#8220;bright line&#8221; distinction for derivative works. A bright line, in much of the legal analysis I&#8217;ve read, is where <em>thing x</em> is so because of <em>thing y</em>, and can be applied across the board. You can clearly see the bright line, and when it has been crossed.</p>\n<p>Washington proves the point quite well that the GNU&#8217;s bright line approach to derivation is quite challengeable. But I don&#8217;t think their arguments prove that WordPress themes in particular are not derivative. I believe, from a legal perspective, it&#8217;s fuzzier than a bright line approach, and if I were Mullenweg or anyone defending GPL software, I would not be excited to take the issue to court.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;spirit of the GPL&#8221; is to offer users liberal freedoms, even while restricting developers building on a GPL licensed application. And I believe there is merit in the fact that WordPress, its co-founders, its lead developers, and the vast majority of its copyright holders (contributors) wish to defend the spirit of the license, even if it&#8217;s not been tested in court.</p>\n<p>Pearson is not in the majority opinion by using a proprietary license, but he is also not definitively in a position of legal wrongdoing. His desire to protect his works from user freedoms with a proprietary license may well be tested all the way to the courts, and he must be prepared to deal with that, but I don&#8217;t believe there is clear wrongdoing, legally, with his license.</p>\n<h2>A tale of idealism</h2>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg and Chris Pearson are two of the most idealistic people I&#8217;ve ever observed. They are near polar opposites, from their business belief systems and even their general world views.</p>\n<p>One of the most depressing components of my research was something Pearson told me. I asked him why he doesn&#8217;t just get out of it all and do something else. He&#8217;s not married to the culture of WordPress bestowed on it by its leaders. He called it, the &#8220;zeitgeist of western culture,&#8221; with its openness, zen attitude, and more that he feels no need to embrace if he doesn&#8217;t want to.</p>\n<p>But he admits that WordPress, &#8220;is the most used piece of software to build a website in the world. WordPress was the beneficiary of impeccable timing.&#8221; And it&#8217;s a tool for him to make his living; it&#8217;s his job, and he doesn&#8217;t see a need to be in love with every aspect of his job. This is what made me sad, because for most of us that make our living within this space, we were able to escape the &#8220;it&#8217;s just a job&#8221; mentality and be emotionally enriched by what is possible on the open web.</p>\n<p>Matt could probably drop his various issues with Pearson and life would go on. The vast majority of WordPress businesses could understand the status quo and live by it, and those that don&#8217;t can keep living their lives outside of the approval of Mullenweg, and for that matter, the official WordPress project and website. But he too insists to stand up for his ideals and the web he believes in. He sees himself as a defender of the user, and his defense of the GPL is an extension of his core beliefs on software.</p>\n<p>They will never agree on licensing, that much is clear. The question of what&#8217;s next is multi-layered.</p>\n<h3>Will litigation continue?</h3>\n<p>Undoubtedly, yes, litigation will continue. But the litigation should be viewed as three distinct parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In regard to the thesis.com domain, it&#8217;s really a sideline issue that resulted from more deep-rooted differences in ideals that turned into a personal spat. Pearson may continue in court to try and get the domain back, but I doubt it. I don&#8217;t know if Automattic will relent on the trademark cancellation requests, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they dropped it in some form of settlement.</li>\n<li>The patent issue is not over. I believe Automattic and potentially other organizations will challenge Pearson&#8217;s patent application using a variety of legal options available. The chances the patent gets approved or holds up long term are unlikely (but yes, it is possible), and I don&#8217;t believe there is a significant chance it will have longstanding implications on the WordPress project.</li>\n<li>I believe the GPL will continue to be tested in court, and eventually we may have a proper precedent set to put current questions aside. I won&#8217;t pretend a guess how it will turn out, because I think it truly depends on many, many factors. I do think that if Matt Mullenweg pursues a case himself, he will be joined by a number of interested organizations, including the Free Software Foundation; or the GPL debate could be settled in court in a completely different dispute, unrelated to WordPress &#8212; but have a longstanding impact on products made for WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is this debate bad for WordPress?</h3>\n<p>The <em>way</em> this debate has occurred is bad for WordPress. Neither Matt Mullenweg nor Chris Pearson looks like a saint right now. And parts of the whole thing don&#8217;t do a whole lot to further the conversation.</p>\n<p>At the root of the debate is licensing, and that debate is worth having.</p>\n<p>It is important that we separate the intent and the legal interpretation of the GPL. It is also important that we separate one&#8217;s legal ability to not license distributed WordPress products as GPL compatible, versus the business and community consequences that may result from such a decision.</p>\n<h2>Endmatter</h2>\n<p>This post would not be possible without the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/partners\">Partners</a> and <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles\">Members</a> that fund the website, and my ability to write about WordPress full time.

McCue invited comments on the post to find out how and where it&#8217;s currently being used, in hopes of identifying any roadblocks developers may be facing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’d love to hear feedback from everyone using this, from JS-only developers coming to WP for the first time, through WordPress plugin and theme developers, all the way through to PHP developers not involved with WordPress,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Comments on the post provide a nice overview of places where the API is already in use in production all over the WordPress development community. A few examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hmn.md/\" target=\"_blank\">Human Made</a> uses the API with client projects, i.e. to create a Node-powered frontend and maintain the familiar WordPress admin.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reactor.apppresser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Reactor</a> uses the API to create mobile apps that digest the API themselves.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://aesopstoryengine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop Interactive</a> uses the API with <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/lasso-frontend-editing-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">Lasso</a> and also to power the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-wp-live-search-plugin-utilizes-the-wp-rest-api\" target=\"_blank\">WP Live Search</a> plugin.</li>\n<li>A large industrial real estate firm manages its properties via an internal proprietary .NET app with a public-facing site powered by WP. It uses the API to sync property data (in real time) between the internal app and the website so the real estate listings will always be current.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.joininuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Join In</a>, a site organizing volunteers in the UK, used the API to create <a href=\"https://www.joininuk.org/widget/\" target=\"_blank\">an embeddable JS widget</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/pers/\" target=\"_blank\">Per Soderlind</a> used the WP REST API as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/rest-api-whos-using-this-thing/#comment-26372\" target=\"_blank\">a backend for an iOS application</a> for the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tri.be/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Tribe</a> is building sites that use the REST API to power both Handlebars and full page React templates in themes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are just a small sampling of places where the API is being used to make WordPress more flexible for creating custom solutions. For many who are using the API or hoping to use it, the main hindrance is that it&#8217;s not yet in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest issue right now is that the REST API isn’t included in core,&#8221; a representative from Ashworth Creative <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/rest-api-whos-using-this-thing/#comment-26390\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a>. &#8220;If we build plugins or a theme that needs to consume data asynchronously, we’d either have to bundle the API and have to maintain it in our repositories as a dependency, or have clients install and maintain it on their own.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress developer Nate Wright echoed that opinion and is eager to be able to extend it for use in his products, without having to include it as a plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Put it in core, so that as a plugin developer I can make use of it in my products,&#8221; he <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/rest-api-whos-using-this-thing/#comment-26367\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I built the most popular Restaurant Reservations plugin in the .org repo, and I am eager to add a robust capacity/table management component for it using the REST API and a jQuery/Underscore/Backbone stack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Early adopters have the unique opportunity to provide feedback on the REST API and help shape priorities for development.

Brad, Ronald, and Ptah were among the first to support WordPress Weekly. They helped get the show off the ground and provided momentum.</p>\n<p>Seven years have passed since I started WordPress Weekly. In those seven years, each one of my guests have gone on to do great things with WordPress. We find out what they&#8217;re up to these days and recall memorable moments of the show. Near the beginning of the show, we held a moment of silence in Kim&#8217;s memory.</p>\n<p>I had a great time hosting episode 200, but I&#8217;m sad that the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away\">late Kim Parsell</a> couldn&#8217;t celebrate with us. When I started WordPress Weekly in 2008, Kim would often join me on each episode to provide a countdown before I pressed the record button.</p>\n<p>She was occasionally a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-87-%E2%80%93-the-lost-episode\">guest on the show</a>. After the show, she would stick around for a half hour to an hour to talk about whatever was on her mind. In many ways, the show offered her an opportunity to connect and speak to WordPress people every week. It was the closest thing to a meetup she could regularly attend.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who listens to the show and provides us with valuable feedback.

It was very hard to make a choice, but can now announce that the birthplace of the United States, <strong>Philadelphia, will host the first WCUS on December 4th&#8211;6th</strong>.

Core contributor Gary Pendergast explained the severity of the bug in the release post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was reported by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href=\"http://www.miqrogroove.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team.</p>\n<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pendergast thanked all parties reporting vulnerabilities for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\" target=\"_blank\">responsibly disclosing them </a> to the WordPress security team.</p>\n<p>This release also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2, including one that might require you to update your database before being allowed back into the admin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wp-update-db.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wp-update-db.jpg?resize=773%2C370\" alt=\"wp-update-db\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47047\" /></a></p>\n<p>Not all WordPress users who are updating will be greeted with this message, but if you see it, don&#8217;t panic.

This pivotal release also gave developers the ability to register their own <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Post_Types\" target=\"_blank\">custom post types</a>. Expanding WordPress&#8217; custom content capabilities beyond simple posts and pages has been critical to the platform maintaining its dominance as <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" target=\"_blank\">the world&#8217;s most used CMS</a>.</p>\n<p>Thousands of WordPress developers make a living from products that are based on custom post types. Five years ago, when the feature was still new, you had to know how to write the code to register a new post type. That&#8217;s when the folks at <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WebDevStudios</a> released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Post Type UI</a>, a plugin that offers an admin interface for creating and managing post types and their associated taxonomies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cptui_post_type_editor.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cptui_post_type_editor.png?resize=1024%2C604\" alt=\"cptui_post_type_editor\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47028\" /></a></p>\n<p>The company counts more than <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webdevstudios/#content-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">30 plugins</a> in its collection on WordPress.org, but Custom Post Type UI is by far the most successful. Last week it passed one million downloads and maintains a 4.6 out of 5-star average rating from users. The plugin is currently active on more than 200,000 WordPress sites.</p>\n<h3>Passing the 1 Million Downloads Milestone</h3>\n<p>Michael Beckwith, the current maintainer of Custom Post Type UI, published a <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2015/07/17/the-custom-post-type-ui-million-download-celebration/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> detailing the evolution of the plugin&#8217;s UI and codebase. His transparent account covers how the team overcame the challenges of their massive codebase overhaul and the undetected bugs that come crawling out of the woodwork with a major release.</p>\n<p>A plugin with a user base in the hundreds of thousands that manages to maintain a nearly 5-star average rating on WordPress.org is a notable achievement, especially when it involves weathering the UI and code updates required to keep pace with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe this milestone represents the fact that making features usable and more user-friendly to the &#8216;average Joe&#8217; can take you a long ways,&#8221; Beckwith said. &#8220;Custom Post Type UI made it easier for more people to tap into the power and customization ability that custom post types and taxonomies offer to a WordPress powered website. Because of that ease of use, many have added it to their toolbox for every website they have or work on, and recommend it to their friends.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin is being developed on <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. Although there are many <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui/labels/enhancement\" target=\"_blank\">enhancements</a> under consideration, Beckwith said that no major changes are planned for the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would love more to get more people up-to-date on the current version and let it be the stable version for awhile,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Looking at our stats page, we still have reported active installs using as far back as version 0.6. While I can sit here scratching my head as to why, I also have to consider that that version is stable enough and still meeting the needs of 0.6% of our users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it is not breaking for them, and there is no security concerns, then it is not all bad that they are still marching on. There is also the minimum version requirement to keep in mind. There are still WordPress installs active and out in the wild that are not running WordPress 3.8 or higher. Until they are, those users are not going to be notified that there is even an update available,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about what it takes to maintain a popular plugin while successfully navigating the years of changes and support, check out WebDevStudios&#8217; <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2015/07/17/the-custom-post-type-ui-million-download-celebration/\" target=\"_blank\">1 million downloads celebration post</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 01:35:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.3 Moves Customize to Its Own Top-level Menu in the Admin Bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=46979\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-moves-customize-to-its-own-top-level-menu-in-the-admin-bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3156:\"<p>When menu management was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-proposed-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3\">proposed to be merged into WordPress 4.3</a>, a common complaint <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-proposed-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3#comment-68988\">expressed by readers</a> was that clicking the Widgets menu item in the admin bar loads the customizer instead of the Widgets admin screen. WordPress 4.3 separates the management interfaces by moving the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-46995 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232\" alt=\"WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar\" /></a>WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-46996 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202\" alt=\"WP43AdminBar\" /></a>WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar\n<p>The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress. This makes it clear which interface users are about to enter. The enhancement is a result of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678\">ticket #32678</a> where Helen Hou-Sandí and other WordPress core contributors discussed ways to improve the context of each link over the course of five weeks.</p>\n<p>Within the ticket, Nick Halsey, who has spent a lot of time on the customizer, explains that the approach taken in the ticket addresses short-term problems while setting the stage for future improvements.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Customizer gets the visibility it deserves and becomes more conceptually separated from &#8216;Appearance&#8217;, the admin becomes significantly more accessible from the front-end, the often-unhelpful dashboard is de-emphasized, etc. We also have the ability to easily upgrade the Customize link to do a much faster/shinier loading of the Customizer in the future without moving it.</p>\n<p>Notably, the add-content and edit-content links remain separated from the admin menu (and we skip submenus there for simplicity), setting us up to be able to point them to a front-end-contextual content-creating/editing experience if we build that in the future, without moving links around. This minor rearrangement should be able to last several years without things moving around much if at all, even as further adjustments are made to the features they point to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the surface, it appears to be a simple change but a lot of time and effort went into it. It required several core contributors to discuss a variety of mockups, ideas, and flows before the team figured out a solution.</p>\n<p>Separating how users enter each interface will be a welcome enhancement to anyone who prefers one over the other to manage themes, widgets, and menus.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 23:28:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: How and When Mullenweg Learned Thesis Changed Back to a Proprietary License\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=46960\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"http://wptavern.com/how-and-when-mullenweg-learned-thesis-changed-back-to-a-proprietary-license\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5837:\"<p>We now know when Matt Mullenweg discovered Chris Pearson changed Thesis&#8217; license from split GPL to a proprietary one. On April 1st 2014, Siobhan McKeown <a href=\"http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_01_Mullenweg.html\">interviewed Matt Mullenweg</a> for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/book\">WordPress history book</a>.</p>\n<p>In the interview, we learn about the history of WordPress themes, the GPL, how Automattic unintentionally created the commercial theme market, why 200 themes were removed from the directory for sponsored links and much more.</p>\n<p>At the 30 minute mark, McKeown asks Mullenweg, at what point did he decide to go to the Software Freedom Law Center to receive clarification on if the default themes that ship with WordPress are derivatives? He responds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe that was around our engagement with Mr. Pearson. I don&#8217;t know if it was before or after the Mixergy interview with our spirited online debate, but it was definitely around that time. I&#8217;m not a lawyer! I can read it and I can understand it from a logical point of view, but the Software Freedom Law Center is obviously the world experts in this and having them officially opine is the closest we can get to &#8211; it&#8217;s the next best thing to having a court case.</p>\n<p>I was actually very excited that perhaps Chris would actually go to court, because as you know there isn&#8217;t a ton of case law around the GPL and normally, because no one is stubborn enough to actually go to court over it, and I thought, &#8220;Oh, we finally got one!&#8221; And I was looking forward to being able to discuss in the U.S. law system and provide the precedent for anyone who comes after us to protect the GPL.</p>\n<p>Because companies like Cisco and LinkSys and huge companies with billions of dollars in resources have opted to not fight it, so you really do need someone who is going to be stubborn enough to fight it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the climax of the debate in 2010, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2010/07/syn-thesis-1/#comment-481743\">some members</a> of the WordPress community wanted to see the argument go to court so a ruling could set a precedent on when a work becomes derivative.</p>\n<p>At the 33 minute mark, McKeown informs Mullenweg that Thesis switched from a split GPL license to a proprietary license. This is the first time since his debate with Pearson in 2010, that Mullenweg discovers Thesis switched back to a proprietary license. He responds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have not seen that. So we&#8217;d have to do a code analysis again. As you know the Software Freedom Law Center says that non-PHP, so non-linked code which can be CSS, images and JavaScript, isn&#8217;t required to be GPL. It doesn&#8217;t trigger the viral nature of WordPress&#8217; GPL code.</p>\n<p>The stance of the WordPress community was that a theme without images or CSS isn&#8217;t much of a theme so, even though something could be legally compliant, if the entire package isn&#8217;t providing the same freedoms for users it&#8217;s not something that we want to link to or promote. Because it doesn&#8217;t really follow the things that we hold dear and true in WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On January 15, 2014, <a href=\"http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php\">Chris Pearson received</a> a copy of Mullenweg&#8217;s inquiry into thesis.com from Larry of GetYourDomain.com. This is approximately four months prior to discovering Thesis was being sold under a proprietary license. However, the exact date in which Mullenweg obtained ownership of the domain is unknown.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-matt.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-46845\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-matt.png?resize=486%2C191\" alt=\"Email shared by Pearson showing Mullenweg\'s interest in the domain\" /></a>Email shared by Pearson showing Mullenweg&#8217;s interest in the domain\n<p>The first <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks\">publicly known use of the domain</a> that confirmed Mullenweg&#8217;s ownership was on October 26th, 2014, at WordCamp San Francisco during the Question and Answer session.</p>\n<p>As the interview continues, McKeown asks Mullenweg if he reached out to companies like Template Monster that sells WordPress themes that are not GPL Licensed.

There&#8217;s always ways to word licenses around multi-site support where perhaps the code is GPL but the developer chooses to not provide support for more than one site unless you buy a special license.

The plugin makes it easy for site administrators to create and manage member types in the admin &#8211; without having to write any code.</p>\n<p>A quick overview of its features includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create/Edit/Delete Member Types from WordPress admin</li>\n<li>Bulk assign member type to users from the users list screen</li>\n<li>A member type can be marked active/inactive from the edit member type page</li>\n<li>Compatible with multisite installations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When creating a new member type, administrators have the option to enable a directory that will list all members from that type on one page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create-member-type.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create-member-type.png?resize=968%2C725\" alt=\"create-member-type\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46984\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to add the plugin and separate your members into different types, the task is not as overwhelming as it might sound. When you visit the user listing page in the admin, you can use the plugin&#8217;s bulk &#8220;change member type&#8221; dropdown to bulk assign users to a new member type. (This feature is also available in the Extended Profile section for each individual user in the admin.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/change-member-type.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/change-member-type.png?resize=737%2C440\" alt=\"change-member-type\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46988\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to make the member types available for selection upon user registration, Singh created a free companion plugin called <a href=\"http://buddydev.com/buddypress/using-buddypress-member-type-as-profile-field-introducing-bp-xprofile-member-type-field-plugin/\" target=\"_blank\">BP Xprofile Member Type Field</a> that puts this on the frontend. If you want to restrict members from modifying their user type after registration, you can also add the free <a href=\"http://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-non-editable-profile-fields/\" target=\"_blank\">Non Editable Profile</a> field plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/registration-member-type-field.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/registration-member-type-field.png?resize=490%2C337\" alt=\"registration-member-type-field\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46992\" /></a></p>\n<p>Please note that BP Member Type Generator cannot detect and manage other member types that have previously been added via code in a plugin. This might create some confusion if you already have existing member types. However, if you&#8217;re just starting with setting up and organizing member types, or are willing to reorganize member types, the BP Member Type Generator offers an easy way to do it.</p>\n<p>This plugin is an important and much needed new tool that puts the creation of unique member types into the hands of BuddyPress community administrators, regardless of skill level. You can download <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-member-type-generator/\" target=\"_blank\">BP Member Type Generator</a> for free from WordPress.org.

According <a href=\"http://www.lassosoft.com/What-Is-Lasso\">to LassoSoft</a>, &#8220;Lasso is a development platform and is the easiest, quickest and most secure method of supporting custom, data-driven web sites on the market today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before launching a product, Haskins searches Google to see if similar products exist with the same name, &#8220;Apparently we didn’t look hard enough when naming Lasso,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h2>Three Requirements That Must Be Met</h2>\n<p>Haskins <a href=\"http://cl.ly/39400J3A100k\">shared the letter</a> to educate others in the business of WordPress. In the letter, attorney&#8217;s for LassoSoft point out the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=861046116\">registered trademarks</a> and says it commenced using the mark in the US in 1998 and in Canada in 1997.</p>\n<p>LassoSoft claims to have documented at least one case of confusion between the two brands and says the continued use of Lasso will cause even more confusion.</p>\n<p>Attorney&#8217;s for LassoSoft provided three requirements that must be met for an amicable end to the dispute:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Permanently ceasing all use of the term &#8220;Lasso&#8221; and any trademark which includes or incorporates the term &#8220;Lasso&#8221;, in connection with any software or related goods and services.</li>\n<li>Removing all references to the term &#8220;Lasso&#8221; from the Website.</li>\n<li>Removing all references to the term &#8220;Lasso&#8221; from any marketing materials including flyers, catalogs, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Haskins has until <strong>July 29th</strong> to satisfy the requirements and provide LassoSoft with written confirmation that he has permanently ceased all use of the term &#8220;Lasso&#8221; in association with software.</p>\n<h2>Transitioning Momentum</h2>\n<p>Rebranding a product that has momentum can be a crushing blow to a business that doesn&#8217;t manage the transition correctly. I asked Haskins how he plans to shift momentum from Lasso to the new brand name.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first idea I had, was to let the community rename it, possibly even have a $500 prize to the winning name. By incentivizing a rebranding campaign, together with a concentrated effort on re-educating, along with URL redirects and custom messages, I feel pretty strongly that we&#8217;ll be able to move right along without skipping a beat,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>When it comes to naming a WordPress product and launching it into the WordPress ecosystem, Haskins offers the following advice:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Use Google to see if it already exists either in the WordPress ecosystem or in a related field. This may seem like a no-brainer and it&#8217;s really common sense, but for some reason, I either never searched or that company never popped up. At any rate, I think you&#8217;ll be in good shape by sticking to something with wp prefixed or appended to the name.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Avoid generic terms and verbs because apparently, you can trademark a verb. I&#8217;d also run the search again in six months and if it&#8217;s a product that you plan on working on for a while, go through the process of getting the term trademarked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to Haskins&#8217; advice, I recommend using a search and discovery process provided by legal counsel familiar with trademark law.</p>\n<h2>Help Haskins Rebrand Lasso</h2>\n<p>In light of the battle between <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks\">Chris Pearson and Matt Mullenweg</a> involving patents, GPL, and trademarks, Haskins decided to rebrand Lasso, &#8220;There are a lot more important things in life than the name of a plugin for WordPress,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Haskins is giving the community an opportunity to rebrand his product. So far, he&#8217;s ruled out WP Front End Editor as it&#8217;s too similar to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/\">name of a feature plugin</a> that may one day be merged into WordPress core.</p>\n<p>If you have an idea on what to call Lasso, please leave a comment on this post. Sometime next week, Haskins will gather the suggestions and publish a poll where the community can vote on which one is best.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 01:08:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:10:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sat, 15 Aug 2015 13:04:03 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"265957\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sat, 15 Aug 2015 12:45:18 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 249\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911080210\";}','no');

	(8,1,'2015-08-15 13:33:18','2015-08-15 13:33:18','About a third of U.S. college presidents believe sexual assault is a problem on American college campuses, but only 6 percent believe it’s a problem on their own campuses. That’s according to Inside Higher Ed’s fifth annual <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/download/2015PresidentsSurvey.html\" target=\"_blank\">Survey of College and University Presidents</a>, which was released Friday. The survey covered a range of topics, including the <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/college-affordability/college-ratings-and-paying-performance\" target=\"_blank\">Obama administration’s college ratings proposal</a> and the sustainability of college financial models, but the most significant (and alarming) finding was about the presidents’ thoughts on the prevalence of sexual assault on campus.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-70521 aligncenter\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/munguia-datalab-highered.png?w=610&amp;h=323\" alt=\"munguia-datalab-highered\" width=\"610\" height=\"323\" />\r\n\r\nCollege presidents appear to be out of touch.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Education in May <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-ix-sexual-violence-investigations\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> a list of 55<b></b>institutions with open investigations into Title IX sexual violence violations. Since then, that list has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/07/barnard-college-title-ix-investigations_n_6432596.html\" target=\"_blank\">periodically</a> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/college-sex-assault-cases_n_5675564.html\" target=\"_blank\">updated</a>; as of January, it named 94 schools, including large public institutions such as Arizona State University and small liberal arts colleges like Sarah Lawrence. Some lawmakers have made campus sexual assault a <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/07/30/15185/flurry-new-legislation-targets-sexual-assault-campus\" target=\"_blank\">priority</a>, most notably with California’s recently passed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB967\" target=\"_blank\">affirmative consent standard</a> and with the pending federal <a href=\"http://time.com/3058840/campus-sexual-assault-bipartisan-bill-aims-to-reform-the-investigation-process/\" target=\"_blank\">Campus Accountability and Safety Act</a>.\r\n\r\nAs my colleague Carl Bialik has <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-we-know-about-sexual-assault-in-college-and-what-we-dont/\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a>, the data on sexual assault in college is hard to interpret, largely because of issues with the question of consent and because so many cases go unreported. One Justice Department-funded <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=240972\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> found that only 12 percent of college students who were the victims of sexual assault reported it — 4 percentage points lower than the general population — and that number was cut in half when the incident involved alcohol.\r\n\r\nStudents and advocates across the country have demanded that administrations take more responsibility for the handling of sexual assault on campus. But very few of the college presidents surveyed (4 percent) were willing to say their school was doing an inadequate job of protecting women from sexual assault. Seventy-seven percent told Inside Higher Ed that their schools are doing a good job, and 19 percent were neutral on the question.\r\n\r\nThat doesn’t bode well for addressing students’ concerns.','College Presidents Appear To Be Delusional About Sexual Assault On Their Campuses','','publish','closed','closed','','college-presidents-appear-to-be-delusional-about-sexual-assault-on-their-campuses','','','2015-08-15 13:33:18','2015-08-15 13:33:18','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?post_type=article&#038;p=8',0,'article','',0),

Statistics show that the number of men between the ages of 25 and 54 who don’t work has tripled since the 1960s — and a disproportionate amount of that growth in joblesness has happened since 2000. Why the sudden rise? Changes in the way things like education, disability and retirement affect our lives (and men’s lives, specifically) are the main culprit, the Times found.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" wp-image-63660\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screenshot-2014-12-19-09-40-47.png?w=1199&amp;h=621\" alt=\"Screenshot 2014-12-19 09.40.47\" width=\"1199\" height=\"621\" />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://themendozaline.org/post/105272851456/hundreds-of-police-killings-go-unreported-to-the\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Police killings:</strong></a> Visual journalist David Mendoza charted data provided by the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hundreds-of-police-killings-are-uncounted-in-federal-statistics-1417577504\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a> that shows the vast discrepancies between the number of police killings government agencies record and the number they report to the FBI. Most of these agencies don’t report any killings to the FBI, but some report more killings to the FBI than they record themselves — once again highlighting the fact that <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-the-police-kill-each-year/\" target=\"_blank\">we have no idea how many people are killed by police each year</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/ferguson-school-segregation?utm_campaign=sprout&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=1419002314\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ferguson and school segregation:</strong></a> Michael Brown beat the odds in St. Louis County by graduating from high school, ProPublica reports. A long history of enforced housing segregation in the region has had lasting effects that are still felt today in the form of de facto school segregation. The differences in accreditation status, four-year graduation rate, average teacher salary, average spending per pupil, percentage of core classes taught by “highly qualified” teachers, and composite ACT scores between two districts just 5 miles apart — one predominantly white and one predominantly black — are staggering.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" wp-image-63674\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screenshot-2014-12-19-10-51-28.png?w=768&amp;h=961\" alt=\"Screenshot 2014-12-19 10.51.28\" width=\"768\" height=\"961\" />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hardballtimes.com/extending-ryan-howard-is-not-what-killed-the-phillies/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The death of the Phillies:</strong></a> Over at The Hardball Times, Matt Swartz took a look at what exactly has been causing Philadelphia’s fall from baseball grace in recent years. The decision to extend first baseman Ryan Howard’s contract in 2011 was met with a lot of flak, but as Swartz explains in depth, the Phillies’ problems are more complicated. That doesn’t mean, however, that there isn’t a simple solution: General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr.’s anti-stats philosophy — “when it comes to scouting heart and head, you can’t do it with sabermetrics” — seems to be holding the team back.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/housing/2014/12/no-ones-very-good-at-correctly-identifying-gentrification/383724/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gentrification:</strong></a> CityLab explored a paper on how we discuss gentrification released earlier this month. Sociologist Michael Barton took The New York Times to task for the differences between how the newspaper defines gentrification in New York City and how researchers define it. The accepted measures of the phenomenon in the academic sphere highlight the biases of the Times (which are most likely shared by other journalistic outlets) — namely, an overeagerness to call areas of Manhattan and northern Brooklyn “gentrified,” and an ignorance of deeper Brooklyn and the Bronx.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" wp-image-63679\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screenshot-2014-12-19-11-10-55.png?w=1292&amp;h=883\" alt=\"Screenshot 2014-12-19 11.10.55\" width=\"1292\" height=\"883\" />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/egypt-highest-number-atheists-arab-world-866?CMP=share_btn_tw\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Religiosity in Egypt:</strong></a> The Guardian’s Patrick Kingsley took a look at the official numbers of resident atheists recorded by government clerics in Middle Eastern countries — focusing on Egypt specifically, but also citing Morocco and Yemen.

Self-proclaimed secularists and atheists in these countries laugh off these precise numbers, saying their governments are in denial of the steady rise of atheism.','Ctrl + ← Men Not At Work, Segregation And Gentrification','','publish','closed','closed','','ctrl-%e2%86%90-men-not-at-work-segregation-and-gentrification','','','2015-08-15 13:35:52','2015-08-15 13:35:52','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?post_type=article&#038;p=9',0,'article','',0),

It\'s different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:\n\n<blockquote>Hi there! I\'m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin\' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>\n\n...or something like this:\n\n<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>\n\nAs a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href=\"http://hemdash.dev/wp-admin/\">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Loretta Lynch are expected to unveil a program Friday that will offer Pell grants — financial aid for college courses that doesn’t need to be repaid — to some inmates as part of an experimental pilot program.\r\n\r\nCongress banned the use of Pell grants by prisoners in 1994. But Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced a <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/05/22/democratic-bill-pell-prisoners\">bill</a> in May to reinstate prisoners’ eligibility for the grants, which can amount to as much as $5,775 for the 2015-16 school year. Anticipating Duncan and Lynch’s announcement, a Republican congressman <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/07/30/congressman-moves-to-block-pell-grants-for-prisoners/\">introduced a bill</a> late Wednesday that would forbid the Education Department from providing higher education funding to prisoners for experimental purposes.\r\n\r\nBut amid a national discussion on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/releasing-drug-offenders-wont-end-mass-incarceration/\">mass incarceration</a>, researchers say correctional education programs can improve the employment rate for offenders after they’re released and reduce the chance they’ll offend again.\r\n\r\nThe RAND Corp., a nonprofit global policy think tank, has conducted extensive analyses of the available research on prison education programs. According to one RAND <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR564.html\">study</a>, the elimination of Pell grant funding for prisoners had a profoundly negative effect on prison postsecondary education programs. Within one year of its elimination, participation in these programs dropped 44 percent. About half of all postsecondary correctional education programs closed.<a class=\"footnote-link\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/obama-pell-grants-prisons/#fn-1\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a>\r\n\r\n“Our survey results suggest that reinstatement of the Pell grants for this population may have a substantial effect in expanding postsecondary opportunities for state prisoners,” the authors wrote, noting that “these courses today are primarily paid for by the individual inmate or family finances” and that many inmates can’t afford the cost.\r\n\r\nLois M. Davis, the report’s lead author, said she couldn’t quantify the exact effect that the program’s reinstatement might have on prisoner participation in postsecondary education, but she said it will definitely save taxpayers money.\r\n\r\n“We looked at the direct cost of prison education versus the cost of reincarceration, and we were able to show that every dollar spent on prison education saves taxpayers four to five dollars on reincarceration costs,” Davis said in an interview Wednesday. “And that’s a conservative estimate.”\r\n\r\nFor taxpayers to break even on these programs, Davis said they would have to reduce recidivism (committing another crime or violating probation or parole) by 1 percent to 2 percent. RAND found that prison education programs overall reduce recidivism by 13 percent and that postsecondary programs specifically reduce it by 16 percent. “When you think about the range of programs that are offered in the prison setting, the evidence is very mixed,” Davis said. “But when it comes to education, it’s clear that it really has a dramatic effect in terms of helping individuals gain the kind of knowledge and skills they need to be successful once they get out.”\r\n\r\nEven apart from direct financial return on investment, these programs have broader ripple effects. For some inmates, it could start a family tradition of pursuing a college education. The RAND report noted that in 2004, the latest year for which data is available, 37 percent of ex-offenders nationwide had not graduated from high school, and only 14.4 percent had some postsecondary education (compared with 19 percent and 51 percent of the general U.S. adult population, respectively). “For many of these individuals, it may be the first time in their family that someone’s attempting to take college courses,” Davis said.\r\n\r\nShe added that it’s important to think about these and other broader consequences of improving access to postsecondary education for prisoners.\r\n\r\n“When we send people to prison, it doesn’t mean the problem just goes away,” she said. “Ninety-five percent of people who go to prison come back to their community afterward. So the question really is: For your community, how do we ensure that these individuals don’t return and reoffend?”\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</article>\r\n<div class=\"entry-footnotes\">\r\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\r\n<div class=\"entry-footnotes-content\">\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n	<li id=\"fn-1\">There had been 772 on-site prison postsecondary programs operating in 1,287 correctional institutions in the U.S. <a class=\"footnote-back\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/obama-pell-grants-prisons/#ss-1\">^</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Helping Inmates Pay For College Could Dramatically Reduce Incarceration','','publish','open','open','','helping-inmates-pay-for-college-could-dramatically-reduce-incarceration','','','2015-08-16 14:30:26','2015-08-16 14:30:26','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?p=84',0,'post','',0),

The tradition began centuries ago as a way to transport bulls from their corrals to the bullfighting ring, and grew as more people decided it would be fun to run in front of the bulls and try not to die. Literally the only point of going is to survive extreme risk (and to slap a bull on the butt, apparently). And yet it seems just as popular on bucket lists now1 as it was when it shot to worldwide fame in 1926 with its depiction in Ernest Hemingway’s novel “The Sun Also Rises.” The danger is the appeal — but just how dangerous is it to run with the Pamplona bulls?\r\n\r\nRecord keeping on deaths (there have been 15) goes back to 1922, and Navarra — the region of Spain where the festival takes place — has kept track of every major injury that has resulted from the run since 1980. Using their data, I decided to find out for myself what the odds will be of ending up in a Navarra hospital when I inevitably partake in this exercise in idiocy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of injuries has been volatile from year to year, it’s grown by about 5.1 percent on average each year since 1980.\r\n\r\nmunguia-datalab-bulls-1\r\n\r\nThat’s what you might expect if attendance were growing, but it’s not. Pamplona’s City Hall has tracked exact annual headcounts since only 2011 (and hasn’t published numbers for 2015 yet), but the limited available data suggests that attendance is on the decline — 17,126 people participated last year, down from 20,500 in 2011.2\r\n\r\nWith injuries going up and attendance going down, each person who runs alongside the bulls has a higher risk of being injured every year. Based on 2014’s data, you’d have a 0.3 percent chance of being injured, which is the same chance of having an unproduced screenplay turned into a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t mean you should go ahead and don that pañuelo just yet. The Associated Press has kept detailed reports on how many people were gored — and the countries they hail from — every day of the festival dating to 2005. I used Nexis to determine whether runners from any nationality stood out. Obviously, Spaniards were hit hardest in terms of the raw number of gorings — 37 of the total 78 over the 10-year period. But Brits take home the prize for most disproportionate number of participants gored.

The annual nine-day running of the bulls festival in Pamplona, Spain, drew to a close today, with the inevitable bloody results: None was gored today, but five were hospitalized with major injuries in the last of eight runs.</span>\r\n\r\nThe festival is one of the most jarring examples of just how imperfect a process natural selection is. The tradition began centuries ago as a way to transport bulls from their corrals to the bullfighting ring, and grew as more people decided it would be fun to run in front of the bulls and try not to die. Literally the only point of going is to survive extreme risk (and to slap a bull on the butt, apparently). And yet it seems just as popular on bucket lists now1 as it was when it shot to worldwide fame in 1926 with its depiction in Ernest Hemingway’s novel “The Sun Also Rises.” The danger is the appeal — but just how dangerous is it to run with the Pamplona bulls?\r\n\r\nRecord keeping on deaths (there have been 15) goes back to 1922, and Navarra — the region of Spain where the festival takes place — has kept track of every major injury that has resulted from the run since 1980. Using their data, I decided to find out for myself what the odds will be of ending up in a Navarra hospital when I inevitably partake in this exercise in idiocy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of injuries has been volatile from year to year, it’s grown by about 5.1 percent on average each year since 1980.\r\n\r\nmunguia-datalab-bulls-1\r\n\r\nThat’s what you might expect if attendance were growing, but it’s not. Pamplona’s City Hall has tracked exact annual headcounts since only 2011 (and hasn’t published numbers for 2015 yet), but the limited available data suggests that attendance is on the decline — 17,126 people participated last year, down from 20,500 in 2011.2\r\n\r\nWith injuries going up and attendance going down, each person who runs alongside the bulls has a higher risk of being injured every year. Based on 2014’s data, you’d have a 0.3 percent chance of being injured, which is the same chance of having an unproduced screenplay turned into a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t mean you should go ahead and don that pañuelo just yet. The Associated Press has kept detailed reports on how many people were gored — and the countries they hail from — every day of the festival dating to 2005. I used Nexis to determine whether runners from any nationality stood out. Obviously, Spaniards were hit hardest in terms of the raw number of gorings — 37 of the total 78 over the 10-year period.

	(89,2,'2015-08-16 13:53:33','2015-08-16 13:53:33','Every time a new set of statistics on abortion is released, a debate ensues about what the numbers mean and how they should be used. The <a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/healthnews/8520497-74/abortion-abortions-states#axzz3eV5SWk5E\">latest example</a> came in June, when The Associated Press released a survey showing that the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 12 percent from 2010 to 2014. The study sparked a <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-rate-is-falling-because-fewer-women-are-getting-pregnant/\">lively conversation</a> along familiar ideological lines about whether the drop resulted from growth in anti-abortion sentiments or increased use of contraception, and even cold, hard numbers couldn’t provide an answer that satisfied both sides.\r\n\r\nSo why aren’t the numbers enough? Statistics about abortion are murky, and the most helpful numbers tend to be the hardest to get. The AP survey focused on the abortion rate, which is the most widely used and cited stat, but not the only one we have. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks three abortion measures that are important in understanding nationwide trends: the number (sometimes expressed as a percentage), the rate and the ratio.\r\n\r\nThe number is self-explanatory: It’s the total number of abortions in a population. The rate — the statistic that’s most frequently discussed — is the number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. But this number has limitations: Because many reproductive-age women aren’t getting pregnant, the rate alone can’t tell you how likely a pregnant woman is to have an abortion. This is where the abortion ratio — the proportion of all pregnancies that end in abortion rather than a birth — comes in.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at the ratio, researchers divide the abortion rate by the pregnancy rate. This can be a challenge, because to calculate the pregnancy rate, researchers need the raw number of pregnancies, which no government agency collects directly. In fact, a certain percentage of pregnancies are virtually impossible to count, because they end in miscarriage, so to estimate the total number of pregnancies, researchers add the number of abortions and the number of live births, using birth-certificate data.<a class=\"footnote-link\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/understanding-different-measures-of-abortion/#fn-1\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a> They then use the estimated number of pregnancies per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 — the pregnancy rate — and the abortion rate to calculate the abortion ratio.\r\n\r\nThe most up-to-date and transparent data on abortions we have is from 2011 and shows declines in every measure.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-82643\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/munguia-tdvx-feature-abortion.png?w=610&amp;h=475\" alt=\"munguia-tdvx-feature-abortion\" width=\"610\" height=\"475\" />\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, it’s not necessary to take an in-depth look at all three measures to understand nationwide abortion trends.\r\n\r\n“Rates are a good reflection of how common abortion is relative to population size, so that is why they are typically used to describe trends. There are more nuances to interpreting abortion ratios,” CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm said in an email. “Since numbers, rates and ratios provide very different types of information, it is important to use different measures to answer different questions.”\r\n\r\nBut the ratio can contribute to a more detailed understanding of abortion trends. Unlike the rate, the ratio helps us understand whether an abortion resulted from an intended or an unintended pregnancy, which gets at why women are choosing to get an abortion or not. Neither the rate nor the ratio alone lends itself to one political ideology or another, but when the data changes, activists differ in their explanation of the causes and implications.\r\n\r\n“The abortion ratio is a more sophisticated measure that tells you more about women’s choices,” said Elizabeth Ananat, an associate professor of public policy studies and economics at Duke University. “So if you’re worried about people’s spirituality and change of heart, you’ll be more interested in the ratio than the rate.”\r\n\r\nCalculating the abortion rate is more straightforward because it involves less guesswork — part of the abortion ratio is the pregnancy rate, which comes from a variety of sources. But even collecting the data to arrive at the abortion rate is a challenge, said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports legal abortion.\r\n\r\nThe CDC periodically aggregates the number of abortions using data from state health departments. The problem with this strategy, according to Jones, is that data collection is inconsistent from state to state; some states, such as California, gather very little information from providers, and others don’t verify the accuracy of the numbers. Because states have limited resources, the data quality varies widely, making it difficult to create a complete national picture.\r\n\r\nGuttmacher performs an abortion “census” every three years or so, a formidable undertaking that involves mailing a survey to each abortion provider in the country. “If they don’t respond, we send the survey out a second time, a third time, and then we start proactively calling them,” she said.\r\n\r\nWhen they’re finished inputting the survey data, Jones and her team vet their numbers against the CDC’s. Guttmacher uses the CDC data to supplement its census — sometimes health department data will fill in gaps from a particular clinic — and as a check on its work, to make sure the clinic surveys are accurate.\r\n\r\nGuttmacher’s estimates of the abortion rate are widely cited by advocates on both sides of the issue. So are the CDC’s, though abortion researchers like Ananat prefer to use Guttmacher’s data because it’s more comprehensive.\r\n\r\nThe question, then, is how to interpret the data — whether to rely on the more straightforward abortion rate, or take the extra steps to calculate the ratio. The abortion ratio lends itself more easily to discussions of causality because it highlights what <i>share</i> of pregnancies end in abortion. If, for example, more women decided not to have abortions — thanks to changing attitudes or restricted access — we would see the abortion ratio fall dramatically as long as the pregnancy rate remained the same.\r\n\r\nBut, according to Ananat, the abortion ratio is useful only in conjunction with the pregnancy rate. By itself, it says little about attitudes toward abortion or pregnancy. “The abortion ratio used to be very low in this country, before abortion was legal,” she said. “Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about attitudes; it’s all about access.”\r\n\r\nTogether, the abortion ratio and the pregnancy rate can help illustrate two things: first, how many women are getting pregnant at all, and second, when they do get pregnant, whether they decide to have an abortion. If the abortion ratio falls, anti-abortion advocates often contend that women are changing their minds about the morality of the procedure. But that argument is supported only if the pregnancy rate remains stable, showing that births are replacing abortions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a falling abortion ratio is accompanied by a falling pregnancy rate, the likeliest explanation is that fewer women are getting pregnant in the first place. If the pregnancy rate is dropping overall, this likely signals a reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies (pregnancies that were either mistimed or unwanted). A decrease in unintended pregnancies, in turn, affects the number of abortions: Because the vast majority of abortions occur among unintended pregnancies — and unintended pregnancies <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Unintended-Pregnancy-US.html\">account for just over half of all pregnancies</a> — even a small reduction can have a disproportionate effect on the abortion rate. “How likely you are to have an abortion isn’t just driven by your attitudes toward abortion, it’s driven by how much you want to get pregnant,” Ananat said.\r\n\r\nThe abortion ratio’s strength is that it puts abortion rates in the context of broader fertility patterns and can shed more light on women’s decision-making. But the reasons behind these choices remain enigmatic, in part because it’s difficult to determine whether a pregnancy is intended. The only way to measure that is to survey women who have recently had an abortion or given birth. The women who have had an abortion are overwhelmingly likely to say the pregnancy was unintended (except for a small number who had one for medical reasons). But the answers from the women who have just given birth are more unreliable, simply because they are less likely to see their baby as “unintended” once it’s born.\r\n\r\nAll of this means that researchers have to be careful about how they present measures of abortion. “This data is imperfect, particularly because it’s so hard to measure pregnancies or the intendedness of pregnancies,” Ananat said. “And that’s frustrating, because the one thing everyone can agree on is that we want to find answers to these questions.”\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\r\n<div class=\"entry-footnotes-content\">\r\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\r\n	<li id=\"fn-1\">Stillbirths are not included in this calculation. <a class=\"footnote-back\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/understanding-different-measures-of-abortion/#ss-1\">^</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>','Understanding Different Measures Of Abortion','','publish','open','open','','understanding-different-measures-of-abortion','','','2015-08-16 14:30:26','2015-08-16 14:30:26','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?p=89',0,'post','',0),

Students are paired with corporate mentors, and the best-performing graduates are offered a job at IBM.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of a larger trend in high school education that aims to be more intent about preparing students for college or a career straight out of high school. P-TECH in particular has gotten a lot of attention since its opening in 2011, including a <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/301792-obamas-shout-out-to-p-tech-highlights-associate-degree-model/\">shoutout</a> in President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address and his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/nyregion/obama-visits-brooklyn-high-school.html?_r=0\">visit</a> to the school later that year. The school is particularly notable for having a student body that is 96 percent black and Hispanic, groups that have traditionally lagged behind in getting postsecondary degrees and technology jobs. Eighty percent of its students receive free or reduced-price lunch, according to IBM’s data.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, these schools help boost college and career readiness by exposing students to the technology skills necessary for each while they’re still in high school. But how effective are they? Since P-TECH’s first class of alumni is fresh off the graduation stage (two years early, no less), we’re only now starting to be able to determine how well the school can achieve its goals.\r\n\r\n“Any single cohort [of the early college high school model] has four to six years to graduate and earn an associate degree, so you’d have to wait at least that long” to determine the success of the program, said Casey Cobb, associate dean and professor of educational leadership at the University of Connecticut. “After that, employment will be important to track longitudinally, at least two to five years out after they leave the program, to find where the students are.”\r\n\r\nAlthough P-TECH is new, there have been similar models for decades, but there’s been relatively little research on how well these schools’ students perform relative to their counterparts who pursue a more traditional high school education. The most recent comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.air.org/resource/early-college-early-success-early-college-high-school-initiative-impact-study-2013\">study</a> was conducted in 2013 by the American Institutes for Research, which found that students from early college high schools were significantly more likely to attend college after their high school graduation. (The study covered three consecutive ninth-grade cohorts starting with students who were ninth-graders in 2005.

How likely are they to continue their education and get a bachelor’s degree? What’s their average salary after one year in the workforce? Two years? Five years?\r\n\r\n“You have to be practical about any kind of reform,” Litow said. “There’s no such thing as a magic bullet. No one wants to say that we finally found the answer. But the economy has changed dramatically, and we do need to find a way to ensure that students are graduating with a degree and with the proper skills.

Students are paired with corporate mentors, and the best-performing graduates are offered a job at IBM.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of a larger trend in high school education that aims to be more intent about preparing students for college or a career straight out of high school. P-TECH in particular has gotten a lot of attention since its opening in 2011, including a <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/301792-obamas-shout-out-to-p-tech-highlights-associate-degree-model/\">shoutout</a> in President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address and his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/nyregion/obama-visits-brooklyn-high-school.html?_r=0\">visit</a> to the school later that year. The school is particularly notable for having a student body that is 96 percent black and Hispanic, groups that have traditionally lagged behind in getting postsecondary degrees and technology jobs. Eighty percent of its students receive free or reduced-price lunch, according to IBM’s data.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, these schools help boost college and career readiness by exposing students to the technology skills necessary for each while they’re still in high school. But how effective are they? Since P-TECH’s first class of alumni is fresh off the graduation stage (two years early, no less), we’re only now starting to be able to determine how well the school can achieve its goals.\r\n\r\n“Any single cohort [of the early college high school model] has four to six years to graduate and earn an associate degree, so you’d have to wait at least that long” to determine the success of the program, said Casey Cobb, associate dean and professor of educational leadership at the University of Connecticut. “After that, employment will be important to track longitudinally, at least two to five years out after they leave the program, to find where the students are.”\r\n\r\nAlthough P-TECH is new, there have been similar models for decades, but there’s been relatively little research on how well these schools’ students perform relative to their counterparts who pursue a more traditional high school education. The most recent comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.air.org/resource/early-college-early-success-early-college-high-school-initiative-impact-study-2013\">study</a> was conducted in 2013 by the American Institutes for Research, which found that students from early college high schools were significantly more likely to attend college after their high school graduation. (The study covered three consecutive ninth-grade cohorts starting with students who were ninth-graders in 2005. The study period ended in 2011.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.air.org/resource/early-college-early-success-early-college-high-school-initiative-impact-study-2013\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-82206 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/munguia-ptech-0630.png?w=610&amp;h=418\" alt=\"munguia-ptech-0630\" width=\"610\" height=\"418\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe paid internships and professional mentorship that P-TECH provides set it apart from other schools in the model.

	(93,2,'2015-08-16 13:56:47','2015-08-16 13:56:47','The multiracial population, now a small subset of the nation, is growing at three times the rate of the general population, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/\">report</a> from the Pew Research Center released Thursday. And as the group continues to grow, so does our ability to study the diversity of its members’ experiences.\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive historical data we have on the subject is from the Census Bureau, but that data is murky at best. Racial categories on the decennial census have changed dramatically over the years (shoutout to the 1860 options of “black,” “white” and “mulatto.”) There’s also the question of whether or not Hispanic should count as a race. (The Census Bureau considers it an ethnicity, and says Hispanics can be of any race.) And then there’s self-identification: If someone has parents of different races, but she doesn’t consider herself mixed-race, how should she be categorized?\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-80806\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/munguia-datlab-multiracial2.png?w=610&amp;h=342\" alt=\"munguia-datlab-multiracial\" width=\"610\" height=\"342\" />\r\nThe introduction of an option for “two or more races” on the 2000 census opened up a new avenue for studying the growing group of multiracial Americans. That year, 2.4 percent of people chose to identify as multiracial. Ten years later, about 2.9 percent of people chose more than one racial group. Across every racial group, young people were more likely to identify as multiracial.\r\n\r\nThe Pew survey used a broader definition than self-identification; it also took into account people who said they have one parent or even one grandparent of a different race. Under that definition, but maintaining the census race categories, the report found that 6.9 percent of American adults are multiracial. If “Hispanic” were included as a race, that share would grow to 8.9 percent.\r\n\r\nIf determining how to define “multiracial” is difficult, then pinning down a central, shared experience of the multiracial population (on anything from discrimination to acceptance) is impossible. Pew’s associate director, Juliana Menasce Horowitz, said that one of the most surprising findings of the report is just how differently the distinct racial subsets answered questions about their identity and experiences. “People generally tend to think of race as something that’s absolute,” Horowitz said. “But our findings show just how fluid racial identity and the associated experiences can be.”\r\n\r\nWhile <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/\">only 22 percent of those Pew defines as multiracial</a> would categorize themselves that way, those who have a white-Asian background were the most likely to self-identify as multiracial, and those who have a black-American Indian background were the least likely to do so.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-80785 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-10-at-3-05-29-pm.png?w=610\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 3.05.29 PM\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, each group has vastly different experiences with discrimination and acceptance. Biracial black-white adults are more likely to feel accepted by blacks than by whites. More multiracial Hispanics feel they have a lot in common with whites than feel they have a lot in common with Hispanics.

	(94,1,'2015-08-16 13:56:47','2015-08-16 13:56:47','The multiracial population, now a small subset of the nation, is growing at three times the rate of the general population, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/\">report</a> from the Pew Research Center released Thursday. And as the group continues to grow, so does our ability to study the diversity of its members’ experiences.\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive historical data we have on the subject is from the Census Bureau, but that data is murky at best. Racial categories on the decennial census have changed dramatically over the years (shoutout to the 1860 options of “black,” “white” and “mulatto.”) There’s also the question of whether or not Hispanic should count as a race. (The Census Bureau considers it an ethnicity, and says Hispanics can be of any race.) And then there’s self-identification: If someone has parents of different races, but she doesn’t consider herself mixed-race, how should she be categorized?\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-80806\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/munguia-datlab-multiracial2.png?w=610&amp;h=342\" alt=\"munguia-datlab-multiracial\" width=\"610\" height=\"342\" />\r\nThe introduction of an option for “two or more races” on the 2000 census opened up a new avenue for studying the growing group of multiracial Americans. That year, 2.4 percent of people chose to identify as multiracial. Ten years later, about 2.9 percent of people chose more than one racial group. Across every racial group, young people were more likely to identify as multiracial.\r\n\r\nThe Pew survey used a broader definition than self-identification; it also took into account people who said they have one parent or even one grandparent of a different race. Under that definition, but maintaining the census race categories, the report found that 6.9 percent of American adults are multiracial. If “Hispanic” were included as a race, that share would grow to 8.9 percent.\r\n\r\nIf determining how to define “multiracial” is difficult, then pinning down a central, shared experience of the multiracial population (on anything from discrimination to acceptance) is impossible. Pew’s associate director, Juliana Menasce Horowitz, said that one of the most surprising findings of the report is just how differently the distinct racial subsets answered questions about their identity and experiences. “People generally tend to think of race as something that’s absolute,” Horowitz said. “But our findings show just how fluid racial identity and the associated experiences can be.”\r\n\r\nWhile <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/\">only 22 percent of those Pew defines as multiracial</a> would categorize themselves that way, those who have a white-Asian background were the most likely to self-identify as multiracial, and those who have a black-American Indian background were the least likely to do so.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-80785 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-10-at-3-05-29-pm.png?w=610\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 3.05.29 PM\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, each group has vastly different experiences with discrimination and acceptance. Biracial black-white adults are more likely to feel accepted by blacks than by whites. More multiracial Hispanics feel they have a lot in common with whites than feel they have a lot in common with Hispanics. Only 13 percent of people who are biracial black-American Indian feel they have much in common with American Indians.\r\n\r\nThese findings are consistent within subsets of the multiracial population, but there’s almost no pattern of similarity for the broader group.

	(99,2,'2015-08-16 14:01:23','2015-08-16 14:01:23','Jasmine Gipson has long considered a career in teaching. Her mom has been a teacher for almost 20 years, and Gipson is familiar with everything the job entails — including low pay and long hours — and those factors haven’t scared her off.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen how she’s navigated through those things and taken advantage of the benefits she’s received, so the idea of teaching doesn’t seem as scary to me as it might to other people,” Gipson said. Even so, she won’t be teaching this fall after she graduates from Harvard with a degree in African and African-American Studies. She hasn’t taken a teaching career off the table entirely, but she did say that the politics surrounding teaching and concerns about her potential colleagues have made her hesitate. For now, she’ll be working as a fellow for a nonprofit agency that focuses on increasing opportunities for low-income children.\r\n\r\nGipson’s story is one among many in a larger complex trend in education: For a number of reasons, it appears that fewer of our best and brightest young people are becoming teachers. Enrollment in teacher prep programs — both short-term ones like Teach for America and the more traditional college education majors — are on the decline. TFA has experienced a 21 percent decline in applications since 2013; <a href=\"https://title2.ed.gov/Public/Home.aspx\">federal Title II</a> data on teacher prep programs shows a 31 percent decline in enrollment since 2008; and enrollment in graduate education programs has <a href=\"http://cgsnet.org/ckfinder/userfiles/files/GED_report_2013.pdf\">decreased</a> by about 3 percent annually since 2008. These application and enrollment drops have been well documented by the likes of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/education/fewer-top-graduates-want-to-join-teach-for-america.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2015/03/03/389282733/where-have-all-the-teachers-gone\">NPR</a> and<a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/10/22/09enroll.h34.html\">Education Week</a>.\r\n\r\nThe drop could be a holdover from the recession in two ways. First, now that the economy is rebounding, job seekers are on the hunt for more lucrative options. (According to the <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/home/2012-2013-average-starting-teacher-salary.html\">National Education Association</a>, the national average for a starting teacher salary in 2012-13 was $36,141.) Second, education budget cuts nationwide<b>, </b>both during and after the recession, left a bad taste in many prospective teachers’ mouths.\r\n\r\n“In Texas, around 2011, there was a lot of negative press around teaching,” said Michael Marder, the executive director of UTeach, a teacher preparation program that was founded at the University of Texas at Austin and has expanded to 44 universities in 21 states. “Students were going off on field visits and saying that their mentor teachers were upset, that pink slips were being handed out in anticipation of budget cuts. It left a strong impression.”\r\n\r\nMarder added that people who may consider teaching later in their careers have been deterred as well.\r\n\r\n“The press is portraying it in such a way to make people less and less likely to pursue it, and make career changers think three or four times about it,” he said. “What I’ve heard from career changers is, ‘I’m willing to spend a year or so preparing and paying for coursework, take a drop in income, go to a rough school, work with challenging kids — really stretch myself. But if I’m going to do all that, and then they’re going to fire me? Forget it.’”\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-77252\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-feature-teachers-1.png?w=305&amp;h=398\" alt=\"munguia-feature-teachers-1\" width=\"305\" height=\"398\" />It’s likely that the drop in enrollment in teacher certification programs is just a blip on the radar resulting from the recent economic turmoil. Economists seem confident that the number of teaching positions will continue to grow; the National Center for Education Statistics’<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014051\">annual projections</a> show that the number of teaching positions is expected to increase by about 1 percent every year through 2022. But whether or not enrollment numbers rebound, the recent trend has reignited a discussion about who is choosing to become a teacher and, just as important, how good those people are at what they do.\r\n\r\nKate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ), a nonpartisan research and policy organization, believes that the dip in enrollment in teacher training and education programs might be a good thing. With the rebounding economy, it’s possible that many students who were interested in teaching for job security in the midst of the recession have siphoned off to other pursuits.\r\n\r\n“If it’s less academically able students who are choosing not to go into the profession, that would be solving a problem that we have,” she said.\r\n\r\nThat concept — that not all teachers are equal — has long been a political sticking point. The federal government has focused on tracking teacher quality in the hopes of improving standards, especially since the implementation of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Part of the legislation required that all teachers of core academic subjects be “highly qualified” by the 2005-06 school year, but the government has gotten <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/08/27/how-the-public-is-deceived-about-highly-qualified-teachers/\">flak</a> for its amended definition of the term “highly qualified teacher,” which requires only that teachers are “making satisfactory progress toward” completing full state certification. Under that definition, 94 percent of classes in the 2006-07 school year had a highly qualified teacher at the helm, according to the Department of Education’s <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/teaching/nclb-final/index.html?exp=3\">final report</a> on teacher quality under NCLB.\r\n\r\nWalsh says these types of standards are one of the main problems facing the profession.\r\n\r\n“Our nation has placed minimal expectations on what a teacher should be able to know and do,” she said. “The U.S. has historically had an open-door policy into the teaching profession, which has to stop if we’re going to address basic fundamental problems.”\r\n\r\nWhile the federal government sets the minimum bar for teacher qualifications, the real onus is on states to implement their own higher standards. State requirements vary widely: 23 states (including D.C.) don’t have a uniform content-specific degree standard for high school teachers, according to the secretary of education’s most recent <a href=\"https://title2.ed.gov/Public/SecReport.aspx\">report</a> on teacher quality. That means, for example, that some biology teachers might have biology degrees while others don’t.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://title2.ed.gov/Public/Home.aspx\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-77250 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-teachers-screenshot-1.png?w=610&amp;h=498\" alt=\"munguia-teachers-screenshot-1\" width=\"610\" height=\"498\" /></a>\r\n\r\nData from the report also shows that while each state has its own assessment for teacher preparation programs, and its own minimum passing score for those assessments, the national average score cutoff is 56.5, while the national average score of test takers is 71.3. The difference in these two numbers suggests “that the bar may be set relatively low across the board,” according to the report. Cut scores range from 42.6 in Puerto Rico to 70 in Arizona, Illinois and Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nA 2014 <a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/dmsStage/EasyAs\">report</a> from the NCTQ shows that there’s also a low bar for education majors throughout their time in school. It found that education majors made disproportionately higher grades than students in other majors, largely because grading standards for teaching candidates are much lower than for other majors.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/dmsStage/EasyAs\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-77251 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-teachers-screenshot-2.png?w=610&amp;h=251\" alt=\"munguia-teachers-screenshot-2\" width=\"610\" height=\"251\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/dmsStage/EasyAs\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-77249 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-teachers-screenshot-3.png?w=610&amp;h=563\" alt=\"munguia-teachers-screenshot-3\" width=\"610\" height=\"563\" /></a>\r\n\r\n“It’s a very easy major. It’s attracting students who are not serious about teaching,” Walsh said.\r\n\r\nWalsh may have cause to be optimistic about the future of the profession, however: An Educational Researcher <a href=\"http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/who-enters-teaching-encouraging-evidence-status-teaching-improving\">study</a> published in November found that the average SAT scores of students in New York entering the teaching profession have been on a sharp rise since 2007, which mirrors the findings of a 2013 national <a href=\"http://educationnext.org/gains-in-teacher-quality/\">study</a>.\r\n\r\nOnce these teachers have entered the field, however, they might be less likely to stay in the classroom, according to the most recent <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014077\">data</a> from the National Center for Education Statistics.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-77248\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-feature-teachers-2.png?w=610&amp;h=482\" alt=\"munguia-feature-teachers-2\" width=\"610\" height=\"482\" />\r\n\r\nOne such teacher, Jasmine Mack, who teaches family and consumer sciences at Pflugerville High School near Austin, Texas, moved to teaching two years ago after two and a half years at a nonprofit agency. She’d always wanted to be a teacher but was initially deterred by the stigma. “When I was a freshman in college, my dad said, ‘Absolutely not. I’m not paying for your college when I know you’re going to be a slave and not make any money or get any appreciation.’ So I gave it up and decided to go into a different field.”\r\n\r\nShe did find her way to teaching, but she was quickly disillusioned, and now she’s leaving the profession at the end of this school year.\r\n\r\n“It was a very hard decision. I do enjoy what I do,” she said. “But it feels like there’s always more being added to your plate. You’re working a ton of hours, having to go to trainings, always having to be implementing new things in the classroom with no extra time, help or money to do so. Why would I stay?”\r\n\r\nWalsh and Mack agree that to attract the best possible teachers to the profession — and to keep them there — better incentives are key.\r\n\r\n“Districts and states need to make it possible to earn a nice salary if you’re good at your job,” Walsh said. “If you want to attract really good people, you’re going to have to reward them for being good.”\r\n\r\nBut improving teacher pay — especially based on quality and experience — is easier said than done.\r\n\r\n“The problem is that there is no market mechanism I can see to stem the tide of teachers fleeing or choosing not to go in the first place,” Marder said. “Just because the state requires something to be taught doesn’t mean salaries will rise to protect the teachers who teach it.”\r\n\r\n<strong><b>CORRECTION (May 13, 6:57 p.m.):</b></strong> An earlier version of this story misidentified the publication Education Week as Education Weekly.','Are There Too Few Teachers, Or Too Few Good Ones?','','publish','open','open','','are-there-too-few-teachers-or-too-few-good-ones','','','2015-08-16 14:30:26','2015-08-16 14:30:26','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?p=99',0,'post','',0),

Second, education budget cuts nationwide<b>, </b>both during and after the recession, left a bad taste in many prospective teachers’ mouths.\r\n\r\n“In Texas, around 2011, there was a lot of negative press around teaching,” said Michael Marder, the executive director of UTeach, a teacher preparation program that was founded at the University of Texas at Austin and has expanded to 44 universities in 21 states. “Students were going off on field visits and saying that their mentor teachers were upset, that pink slips were being handed out in anticipation of budget cuts. It left a strong impression.”\r\n\r\nMarder added that people who may consider teaching later in their careers have been deterred as well.\r\n\r\n“The press is portraying it in such a way to make people less and less likely to pursue it, and make career changers think three or four times about it,” he said. “What I’ve heard from career changers is, ‘I’m willing to spend a year or so preparing and paying for coursework, take a drop in income, go to a rough school, work with challenging kids — really stretch myself. But if I’m going to do all that, and then they’re going to fire me? Forget it.’”\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-77252\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-feature-teachers-1.png?w=305&amp;h=398\" alt=\"munguia-feature-teachers-1\" width=\"305\" height=\"398\" />It’s likely that the drop in enrollment in teacher certification programs is just a blip on the radar resulting from the recent economic turmoil. Economists seem confident that the number of teaching positions will continue to grow; the National Center for Education Statistics’<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014051\">annual projections</a> show that the number of teaching positions is expected to increase by about 1 percent every year through 2022. But whether or not enrollment numbers rebound, the recent trend has reignited a discussion about who is choosing to become a teacher and, just as important, how good those people are at what they do.\r\n\r\nKate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ), a nonpartisan research and policy organization, believes that the dip in enrollment in teacher training and education programs might be a good thing. With the rebounding economy, it’s possible that many students who were interested in teaching for job security in the midst of the recession have siphoned off to other pursuits.\r\n\r\n“If it’s less academically able students who are choosing not to go into the profession, that would be solving a problem that we have,” she said.\r\n\r\nThat concept — that not all teachers are equal — has long been a political sticking point. The federal government has focused on tracking teacher quality in the hopes of improving standards, especially since the implementation of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Part of the legislation required that all teachers of core academic subjects be “highly qualified” by the 2005-06 school year, but the government has gotten <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/08/27/how-the-public-is-deceived-about-highly-qualified-teachers/\">flak</a> for its amended definition of the term “highly qualified teacher,” which requires only that teachers are “making satisfactory progress toward” completing full state certification. Under that definition, 94 percent of classes in the 2006-07 school year had a highly qualified teacher at the helm, according to the Department of Education’s <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/teaching/nclb-final/index.html?exp=3\">final report</a> on teacher quality under NCLB.\r\n\r\nWalsh says these types of standards are one of the main problems facing the profession.\r\n\r\n“Our nation has placed minimal expectations on what a teacher should be able to know and do,” she said. “The U.S. has historically had an open-door policy into the teaching profession, which has to stop if we’re going to address basic fundamental problems.”\r\n\r\nWhile the federal government sets the minimum bar for teacher qualifications, the real onus is on states to implement their own higher standards. State requirements vary widely: 23 states (including D.C.) don’t have a uniform content-specific degree standard for high school teachers, according to the secretary of education’s most recent <a href=\"https://title2.ed.gov/Public/SecReport.aspx\">report</a> on teacher quality. That means, for example, that some biology teachers might have biology degrees while others don’t.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://title2.ed.gov/Public/Home.aspx\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-77250 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-teachers-screenshot-1.png?w=610&amp;h=498\" alt=\"munguia-teachers-screenshot-1\" width=\"610\" height=\"498\" /></a>\r\n\r\nData from the report also shows that while each state has its own assessment for teacher preparation programs, and its own minimum passing score for those assessments, the national average score cutoff is 56.5, while the national average score of test takers is 71.3. The difference in these two numbers suggests “that the bar may be set relatively low across the board,” according to the report. Cut scores range from 42.6 in Puerto Rico to 70 in Arizona, Illinois and Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nA 2014 <a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/dmsStage/EasyAs\">report</a> from the NCTQ shows that there’s also a low bar for education majors throughout their time in school. It found that education majors made disproportionately higher grades than students in other majors, largely because grading standards for teaching candidates are much lower than for other majors.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/dmsStage/EasyAs\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-77251 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-teachers-screenshot-2.png?w=610&amp;h=251\" alt=\"munguia-teachers-screenshot-2\" width=\"610\" height=\"251\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/dmsStage/EasyAs\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-77249 size-full\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-teachers-screenshot-3.png?w=610&amp;h=563\" alt=\"munguia-teachers-screenshot-3\" width=\"610\" height=\"563\" /></a>\r\n\r\n“It’s a very easy major. It’s attracting students who are not serious about teaching,” Walsh said.\r\n\r\nWalsh may have cause to be optimistic about the future of the profession, however: An Educational Researcher <a href=\"http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/who-enters-teaching-encouraging-evidence-status-teaching-improving\">study</a> published in November found that the average SAT scores of students in New York entering the teaching profession have been on a sharp rise since 2007, which mirrors the findings of a 2013 national <a href=\"http://educationnext.org/gains-in-teacher-quality/\">study</a>.\r\n\r\nOnce these teachers have entered the field, however, they might be less likely to stay in the classroom, according to the most recent <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014077\">data</a> from the National Center for Education Statistics.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-77248\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/munguia-feature-teachers-2.png?w=610&amp;h=482\" alt=\"munguia-feature-teachers-2\" width=\"610\" height=\"482\" />\r\n\r\nOne such teacher, Jasmine Mack, who teaches family and consumer sciences at Pflugerville High School near Austin, Texas, moved to teaching two years ago after two and a half years at a nonprofit agency. She’d always wanted to be a teacher but was initially deterred by the stigma. “When I was a freshman in college, my dad said, ‘Absolutely not. I’m not paying for your college when I know you’re going to be a slave and not make any money or get any appreciation.’ So I gave it up and decided to go into a different field.”\r\n\r\nShe did find her way to teaching, but she was quickly disillusioned, and now she’s leaving the profession at the end of this school year.\r\n\r\n“It was a very hard decision. I do enjoy what I do,” she said. “But it feels like there’s always more being added to your plate. You’re working a ton of hours, having to go to trainings, always having to be implementing new things in the classroom with no extra time, help or money to do so. Why would I stay?”\r\n\r\nWalsh and Mack agree that to attract the best possible teachers to the profession — and to keep them there — better incentives are key.\r\n\r\n“Districts and states need to make it possible to earn a nice salary if you’re good at your job,” Walsh said. “If you want to attract really good people, you’re going to have to reward them for being good.”\r\n\r\nBut improving teacher pay — especially based on quality and experience — is easier said than done.\r\n\r\n“The problem is that there is no market mechanism I can see to stem the tide of teachers fleeing or choosing not to go in the first place,” Marder said. “Just because the state requires something to be taught doesn’t mean salaries will rise to protect the teachers who teach it.”\r\n\r\n<strong><b>CORRECTION (May 13, 6:57 p.m.):</b></strong> An earlier version of this story misidentified the publication Education Week as Education Weekly.','Are There Too Few Teachers, Or Too Few Good Ones?','','inherit','open','open','','99-revision-v1','','','2015-08-16 14:01:23','2015-08-16 14:01:23','',99,'http://hemdash.dev/99-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),

(The average investigation into all types of Title IX complaints for those schools, including sexual violence complaints, was only 206 days for cases closed in 2014, suggesting that complaints not involving sexual violence were wrapped up quickly.)\r\n\r\nThe OCR gave several reasons for the prolonged investigations.\r\n\r\n“[S]exual violence investigations tend to be complex and may involve systemic, campus- and institution-wide issues, in addition to issues pertaining to specific students,” the office wrote in <a href=\"http://www.boxer.senate.gov/press/related/150428EducationDepartmentReponsetoLetter.pdf\">a  letter to Boxer</a>, noting that the investigation process for sexual violence complaints includes reviewing the institution’s historical responses to these complaints, interviewing school officials, meeting with individual students and student groups, and reviewing the school’s policies and training protocol. “As such, Title IX sexual violence investigations, on average, take longer to complete than those across other jurisdictions,” the letter said.\r\n\r\nThe office also said that it closed some of its longest-running investigations in 2014. It didn’t give specifics, but <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/06/ocr-letter-says-completed-title-ix-investigations-2014-lasted-more-1400-days\">Inside Higher Ed</a> noted that these included two four-year investigations (one at Harvard Law School and one at Ohio State University) and two three-year investigations (one at Princeton University and one at Southern Methodist University).\r\n\r\nBut the number of lengthy investigations coincides with an uptick in the overall number of complaints made, suggesting that the department may need more resources to handle the increase. In 2014, 102 complaints were filed against higher-ed institutions, compared with 32 in 2013 and nine in 2009. (As of April 8, 2015, the office had received 51 complaints this year.)\r\n\r\nDespite the growth in complaints, the OCR’s staffing and budget levels have both decreased significantly over the years, as the office pointed out in its <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget16/justifications/aa-ocr.pdf\">budget request</a> for fiscal year 2016. One chart from the request shows the discrepancy between the office’s level of full-time equivalent positions (FTE)<a class=\"footnote-link\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/it-takes-years-to-investigate-a-campus-sexual-violence-complaint/#fn-1\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a> and the number of complaints that the office receives:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget16/justifications/aa-ocr.pdf\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-76470\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screenshot-2015-05-06-12-14-22.png?w=610&amp;h=314\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-05-06 12.14.22\" width=\"610\" height=\"314\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe OCR requested a budget of $130.7 million for the 2016 fiscal year — a 31 percent increase from its 2015 appropriation, the bulk of which would fund an additional 200 full-time equivalent positions.\r\n\r\n“OCR expects that these average [investigation lengths] will decrease as the agency closes out its oldest sexual violence cases and if, as we hope, Congress increases OCR’s appropriation to allow OCR to manage its current and projected caseload,” the office wrote in its letter to Sen.

(The average investigation into all types of Title IX complaints for those schools, including sexual violence complaints, was only 206 days for cases closed in 2014, suggesting that complaints not involving sexual violence were wrapped up quickly.)\r\n\r\nThe OCR gave several reasons for the prolonged investigations.\r\n\r\n“[S]exual violence investigations tend to be complex and may involve systemic, campus- and institution-wide issues, in addition to issues pertaining to specific students,” the office wrote in <a href=\"http://www.boxer.senate.gov/press/related/150428EducationDepartmentReponsetoLetter.pdf\">a  letter to Boxer</a>, noting that the investigation process for sexual violence complaints includes reviewing the institution’s historical responses to these complaints, interviewing school officials, meeting with individual students and student groups, and reviewing the school’s policies and training protocol. “As such, Title IX sexual violence investigations, on average, take longer to complete than those across other jurisdictions,” the letter said.\r\n\r\nThe office also said that it closed some of its longest-running investigations in 2014. It didn’t give specifics, but <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/06/ocr-letter-says-completed-title-ix-investigations-2014-lasted-more-1400-days\">Inside Higher Ed</a> noted that these included two four-year investigations (one at Harvard Law School and one at Ohio State University) and two three-year investigations (one at Princeton University and one at Southern Methodist University).\r\n\r\nBut the number of lengthy investigations coincides with an uptick in the overall number of complaints made, suggesting that the department may need more resources to handle the increase. In 2014, 102 complaints were filed against higher-ed institutions, compared with 32 in 2013 and nine in 2009. (As of April 8, 2015, the office had received 51 complaints this year.)\r\n\r\nDespite the growth in complaints, the OCR’s staffing and budget levels have both decreased significantly over the years, as the office pointed out in its <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget16/justifications/aa-ocr.pdf\">budget request</a> for fiscal year 2016. One chart from the request shows the discrepancy between the office’s level of full-time equivalent positions (FTE)<a class=\"footnote-link\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/it-takes-years-to-investigate-a-campus-sexual-violence-complaint/#fn-1\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a> and the number of complaints that the office receives:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget16/justifications/aa-ocr.pdf\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-76470\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screenshot-2015-05-06-12-14-22.png?w=610&amp;h=314\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-05-06 12.14.22\" width=\"610\" height=\"314\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe OCR requested a budget of $130.7 million for the 2016 fiscal year — a 31 percent increase from its 2015 appropriation, the bulk of which would fund an additional 200 full-time equivalent positions.\r\n\r\n“OCR expects that these average [investigation lengths] will decrease as the agency closes out its oldest sexual violence cases and if, as we hope, Congress increases OCR’s appropriation to allow OCR to manage its current and projected caseload,” the office wrote in its letter to Sen. Boxer.\r\n\r\n<em>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post said it was likely that the investigation of a complaint filed in 2010 would still be open four years later.

Jenner spoke about his life-long struggle with his gender identity, and touched on many of the difficulties facing transgender and gender non-conforming people.\r\n\r\nMy colleague Mona Chalabi has <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-we-dont-know-the-size-of-the-transgender-population/\" target=\"_blank\">written</a> before about how little we know about the transgender and gender non-conforming population in the U.S. The best information we have comes from a 2011 <a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> called The National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report, published by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. The report is based on survey responses from 6,456 people who identify as transgender or gender non-conforming.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable moments in the interview was when Sawyer said this was the last interview that Jenner would do as “Bruce,” but that for now, he prefers male pronouns. (FiveThirtyEight will continue to use male pronouns to refer to Jenner until he indicates he prefers otherwise.) As public conversation around the acceptance of transgender and gender non-conforming people has grown, the use of preferred pronouns has been an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/use-of-preferred-gender-pronouns-indicates-expanding-acceptance-of-transgender-people/2013/09/05/25ffdb7e-1595-11e3-804b-d3a1a3a18f2c_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">important issue</a>. The survey didn’t ask respondents whether pronoun preference was important to them or what pronouns they prefer. But the report did find that 45 percent of respondents had been referred to by the wrong pronouns “repeatedly and on purpose” at work — and that respondents with lower incomes were more likely to have experienced this. The following charts are from the NCTE and NGLT<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75068\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-24-12-58-35.png?w=610&amp;h=434\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-24 12.58.35\" width=\"610\" height=\"434\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis finding raises a difference between Jenner and the transgender and gender non-conforming population covered in the survey: his wealth and status as a former Olympic athlete and more recently as a star on E!’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” Unemployment among survey respondents was twice as high as the national average, and survey respondents were much more likely to be living in poverty and much less likely to have a household income of more than $100,000 per year than the average American.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75074\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-24-13-34-24.png?w=610&amp;h=427\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-24 13.34.24\" width=\"610\" height=\"427\" /></a>\r\n\r\nJenner also discussed the difficulty of sharing his gender identity with his family, many of whom appeared in the interview to express their support. That support is important for people who come out as transgender. According to the report, 57 percent of those surveyed experienced family rejection, which was highly correlated with other negative outcomes. Those who experienced family rejection were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide and three times as likely to experience homelessness.\r\n\r\nThe report found that the older the survey respondent was at the time of transition, the less likely they were to have experienced homelessness. “A possible explanation is that prior to a late-life transition process, these respondents may have hidden their transgender identity or gender non-conformity and thus been better able to preserve jobs and secure housing over time,” the report said. Most of those surveyed had transitioned between the ages of 18 and 44. Jenner’s first experience with transitioning, when he was in his 40s, fell into that range. But after five years, he lost his “nerve” and stopped the process, he told Sawyer. Now, at 65 years old, Jenner is well above that group in age.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75076\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-24-13-47-34.png?w=610&amp;h=450\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-24 13.47.34\" width=\"610\" height=\"450\" /></a>\r\n\r\nObviously, it’s wonderful for Jenner that members of his family have been so supportive and that he now feels comfortable speaking publicly about his identity. The more that people of Jenner’s status and fame speak out about their experiences identifying as transgender or gender non-conforming, the more accepted those experiences will become. “What I’m doing is going to do the world some good,” Jenner said. “I would like to think we could save some lives here. Maybe this is my cause in life, this is why God put me on this earth — to deal with this issue.”\r\n\r\n</div>','Bruce Jenner And The Diverse Experiences Of Transgender People','','publish','open','open','','bruce-jenner-and-the-diverse-experiences-of-transgender-people','','','2015-08-16 14:32:16','2015-08-16 14:32:16','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?p=109',0,'post','',0),

The following charts are from the NCTE and NGLT<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75068\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-24-12-58-35.png?w=610&amp;h=434\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-24 12.58.35\" width=\"610\" height=\"434\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis finding raises a difference between Jenner and the transgender and gender non-conforming population covered in the survey: his wealth and status as a former Olympic athlete and more recently as a star on E!’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” Unemployment among survey respondents was twice as high as the national average, and survey respondents were much more likely to be living in poverty and much less likely to have a household income of more than $100,000 per year than the average American.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75074\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-24-13-34-24.png?w=610&amp;h=427\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-24 13.34.24\" width=\"610\" height=\"427\" /></a>\r\n\r\nJenner also discussed the difficulty of sharing his gender identity with his family, many of whom appeared in the interview to express their support. That support is important for people who come out as transgender. According to the report, 57 percent of those surveyed experienced family rejection, which was highly correlated with other negative outcomes. Those who experienced family rejection were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide and three times as likely to experience homelessness.\r\n\r\nThe report found that the older the survey respondent was at the time of transition, the less likely they were to have experienced homelessness. “A possible explanation is that prior to a late-life transition process, these respondents may have hidden their transgender identity or gender non-conformity and thus been better able to preserve jobs and secure housing over time,” the report said. Most of those surveyed had transitioned between the ages of 18 and 44. Jenner’s first experience with transitioning, when he was in his 40s, fell into that range. But after five years, he lost his “nerve” and stopped the process, he told Sawyer. Now, at 65 years old, Jenner is well above that group in age.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75076\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-24-13-47-34.png?w=610&amp;h=450\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-24 13.47.34\" width=\"610\" height=\"450\" /></a>\r\n\r\nObviously, it’s wonderful for Jenner that members of his family have been so supportive and that he now feels comfortable speaking publicly about his identity. The more that people of Jenner’s status and fame speak out about their experiences identifying as transgender or gender non-conforming, the more accepted those experiences will become. “What I’m doing is going to do the world some good,” Jenner said. “I would like to think we could save some lives here. Maybe this is my cause in life, this is why God put me on this earth — to deal with this issue.”\r\n\r\n</div>','Bruce Jenner And The Diverse Experiences Of Transgender People','','inherit','open','open','','109-revision-v1','','','2015-08-16 14:32:16','2015-08-16 14:32:16','',109,'http://hemdash.dev/109-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),

In 2011, women made up 36 percent of the winners, a share that steadily declined to just 8 percent last year. In fact, this year’s ratio demonstrates an overrepresentation of women in the field: Women make up only 36 percent of newspaper newsroom staffs, according to a 2014 <a href=\"http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/2014-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> from the Women’s Media Center.\r\n\r\nThis is great news for women, but given the entire history of the award, the odds are still in men’s favor. So if you’re a female journalist, what exactly could help you beat those odds and win this male-dominated award? A couple of years ago, researchers from the University of Missouri and the Chinese University of Hong Kong decided to <a href=\"http://jmq.sagepub.com/content/90/2/248.full.pdf+html\" target=\"_blank\">find out</a> whether there were any significant differences between male and female Pulitzer winners.\r\n\r\nThey compiled data on every winner in the journalism categories from 1917 to 2010 and then split that data into two time periods: 1917-90 and 1991-2010.<a class=\"footnote-link\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/are-you-a-woman-who-wants-to-win-a-pulitzer-go-to-grad-school/#fn-1\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a> The researchers looked at differences in the qualifications of male and female winners, as well as differences in the types of awards won.

Between 1991 and 2010, the gender gaps across all these factors shrank significantly, and men actually became more likely to win as part of a team.

	(115,1,'2015-08-16 14:36:57','2015-08-16 14:36:57','This week, millions of students across New York will begin taking the state’s annual round of standardized tests, starting with the Common Core English Language Arts test on Tuesday. But it’s not just students’ performance that will be graded — teachers are being evaluated just as much, if not more.\r\n\r\nWhile 30 states require test scores to be considered in teacher evaluations, New York stands out in just how much weight it may soon be putting on the scores. In March, the state legislature approved a hotly contested measure backed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo that takes away district control of teacher evaluations and could allow the education commissioner to use test scores to determine as much as half of a teacher’s evaluation, giving test scores and observations the same weight. Legislators <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/04/8565544/education-officials-role-evaluations-appears-limited\">seem confused</a> about the practical implications of the bill and are investigating the language. The education department has until June 30 to finalize the evaluation system.\r\n\r\nThe bill is just the latest in a flurry of teacher evaluation policy reforms that have been implemented across the country in recent years. New York had already <a href=\"http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/about/888-cuomo-tries-out-a-new-role-the-education-governor\">reformed</a> its teacher evaluations in 2012, but after <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/nyregion/cuomo-gets-deals-on-tenure-and-evaluations-of-teachers.html\">96 percent</a> of teachers were deemed effective last year, Cuomo is looking to rework the system again.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Center on Great Teachers and Leaders at American Institutes for Research, a nonprofit behavioral and social science research organization, every state but California has developed plans for a new system to be implemented at some point between 2011 and 2019. These new models of teacher evaluation include state tests, district tests, classroom observations, student and parent surveys, self-assessments from teachers, lesson-plan reviews, measures of professional learning, and more.\r\n\r\nAll these attempts to reform teacher evaluations are happening as the research on how best to assess teacher quality remains in its earliest stages, and teachers and students are being affected with every shift in policy. “We’re in the Wright brothers stage,” said Jim Hull, a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Education. “We’re getting these policies in the air, and they’re not designed to be as effective as they probably could be. There’s still a lot to learn.”\r\n\r\nOne New York principal, Carol Burris of South Side High School in Rockville Centre, who is also a fellow with the nonprofit National Education Policy Center and who has been an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/04/03/what-the-thoughtless-n-y-government-just-did-to-teachers/\">outspoken opponent</a> of high-stakes testing, said that New York’s policy will affect students for the worse.\r\n\r\n“It puts the test scores in a pre-eminent position, which will have a bad effect on kids,” she said. “We’ve already seen the effects that this has — a narrowing of curriculum and teaching to the test — and that will just become an even more prevalent practice.”\r\n\r\nIn Burris’s ideal world, test scores would play at most a secondary role in teacher evaluations. “I think the role of test scores should be outside the model. Teachers should be evaluated by their principal, and if for some reason that evaluation is way off the mark, then decent test scores can be used as a form of protection to challenge that evaluation,” she said.\r\n\r\nHull understands her anxiety about the new policy. “There’s definitely room for concern when you talk about 50 percent of an evaluation being based on test scores,” he said. “Especially if it’s not a high-quality assessment [of the students] and doesn’t assess a broad range of knowledge.” The quality of student tests is a particularly sticky issue in New York, where the first two years of Common Core <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-08-15/common-core-new-york-test-scores-show-little-improvement\">test results</a>, which have shown outsized gaps between demographic groups, have done little to ease <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/08/17/a-painful-analysis-of-new-common-core-tests-and-the-n-y-results/\">critics’ concerns</a> that scoring well on the tests requires skills that are irrelevant to the subject matter being tested.\r\n\r\nThere are competing views on the best way to approach incorporating student test scores into teacher evaluations. The model that’s currently accepted as the most accurate is known as the “value-added model” because it’s supposed to measure exactly how much of a student’s progress made over the course of the year is thanks to her teacher. It compares each student’s test scores to their own past scores and to other students’ scores. “It’s not perfect, but there is no other measure as good as [the value-added model],” Hull said. “But that’s not to say that other measures shouldn’t be used as well. You really want to have multiple measures of student outcomes.”\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.metproject.org/\">Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) Project</a>, the magnum opus of teacher-evaluation studies — every expert I spoke with on this topic pointed me to it — confirms the idea that student growth, often in the form of test scores, should be included in evaluations, along with other metrics. The project, which was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was a three-year research partnership between 3,000 teacher volunteers and dozens of independent research teams who together developed and tested multiple measures of teacher evaluations to help better identify effective teaching. It didn’t recommend one specific model, given that every district has its own needs, but it did highlight the fact that “heavily weighting a single measure may incentivize teachers to focus too narrowly on a single aspect of effective teaching and neglect its other important aspects.”\r\n\r\nThe project found that an evaluation model heavily weighting standardized test scores was more effective than other models in predicting improvements in how students performed on those tests, but was the least predictive of how students performed on supplemental higher-order tests (usually given at the district or school level), and also produced the least reliable results, based on year-to-year consistency in teachers’ scores. Here are the results, from the project’s <a href=\"http://www.metproject.org/reports.php\">research brief</a>:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metproject.org/reports.php\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-73996 aligncenter\" src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-13-15-05-04.png?w=610&amp;h=732\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-04-13 15.05.04\" width=\"610\" height=\"732\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTexas is in the process of overhauling its evaluation system, and it will value test scores at a maximum of 20 percent — even less than the MET Project’s Model 4. Specifically, Texas’s new model will count “student growth” as 20 percent of a teacher’s score. “But there are four options that districts have for measuring student growth, and just one of them ties back to test scores,” said Tim Regal, the director of educator evaluation and support for the Texas Education Agency.\r\n\r\nTexas’s new model, which will replace a 17-year-old system, is in its pilot year and being implemented in 57 districts. Next year, it will expand to 200 districts before the final statewide implementation in 2016-2017.\r\n\r\nBut rather than just changing the way different factors are weighted, the overhaul is an attempt to transform the way teacher evaluations are used and understood. “Right now, when you talk to teachers in Texas about appraisal, they have a certain mindset because it’s always been used just to determine renewal and nonrenewal,” he said, referring to the common practice of using evaluations solely to determine which teachers to let go. “The only thing that mattered was their score. A lot of our focus during the pilot year has been about how to change that mindset to be about a process of professional development and growth for all teachers.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 20 percent of teachers’ evaluations that will be based on student growth, another 70 percent will be based on observations from principals, assistant principals and other campus leaders, and 10 percent will be based on self-assessment.\r\n\r\nAccording to Angela Minnici, director of the Center on Great Teachers and Leaders, a change in mindset about how teacher evaluations are used is necessary. “We need to move away from thinking about evaluation systems as only ways to dismiss underperformers,” she said. “We really should be thinking about evaluations as a source of power and investment for moving teachers to a better level of performance overall.”\r\n\r\nWhile New York is putting even more emphasis on testing, most states are moving toward a system more like the one in Texas.\r\n\r\n“States are definitely making a big step forward,” Hull said. “Over a short period of time, evaluation systems have gone basically from an exercise in bureaucracy to being given immediate feedback and information on how to improve performance. That type of feedback is how we get the best doctors, best lawyers, and it’s also how we’ll get the best teachers.”','New York’s Complicated Teacher Evaluation Proposal Is The Exception, Not The Rule','','publish','open','open','','new-yorks-complicated-teacher-evaluation-proposal-is-the-exception-not-the-rule','','','2015-08-16 14:36:57','2015-08-16 14:36:57','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?p=115',0,'post','',0),

As O’Connor wrote, “This exercise was a useful reminder that data journalism is no more inherently objective than any other sort of journalism.” [<a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2015/05/06/jobs-and-politics-the-perils-of-data-journalism/\">FT</a>]\r\n\r\n<b>The flash crash</b>: After U.S. prosecutors charged London trader Navinder Singh Sarao with 22 criminal counts last month for his involvement in the May 6, 2010, “Flash Crash,” the Wall Street Journal dug into the minutiae of what exactly happened that day.

Monday marks Y Combinator’s semiannual<a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/demoday/faq/\">Demo Day</a>, when companies make their public debut and solicit investors for more money.\r\n\r\nWe don’t yet know which tech innovations this batch of startups will bring, but we do have an idea of who’s doing the innovating. Y Combinator released stats on its current batch of startup founders last week, and they’re still overwhelmingly white and male. This is the biggest group to date, made up of 114 startups with founders hailing from 18 countries. Of these companies, only 22 percent have a female founder, 8 percent have a black founder and 5 percent have a Hispanic founder.\r\n\r\nThese numbers aren’t necessarily surprising — the lack of diversity in tech has been <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=lack+of+diversity+in+tech&amp;oq=lack+of+diversity+in+tech&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2120j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">well-covered</a>. In the past, Y Combinator itself has acknowledged that it could do a better job. Its president, Sam Altman, <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups\" target=\"_blank\">has written</a> that “sexism in tech is real” and that “we — the tech industry as a whole — need to fix this.”\r\n\r\nSelecting companies with diverse leadership to fund is one of the ways to fix it. The people leading companies today are the ones who become gatekeepers in the future. Although funding from Y Combinator doesn’t guarantee success, the company has a remarkable rate for picking winners: According to incubator database <a href=\"http://www.seed-db.com/accelerators\" target=\"_blank\">Seed-DB</a>, only 11 percent of the startups that Y Combinator has funded have died. Given the stature that founders have in the tech world, that means that every Demo Day announces more entrants into the next generation of tech big shots.\r\n\r\nI reached out to the company to get historical stats on the diversity of their startups to put these numbers in perspective. Y Combinator hasn’t tracked race or ethnicity previously, but it did give me the data on how many women founders have been in each batch. You can see the year-by-year breakdown in the chart above. Female representation in Y Combinator batches has grown, but seemingly not as much as the call for more diversity in tech.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t appear that Y Combinator is selecting more women than are applying. The incubator hasn’t asked applicants for their gender until this batch, but a random sample of the video applications from last summer’s batch showed that 24 percent of the startups that applied had a female founder, according to Y Combinator. In that batch, 20 percent of the startups that the company funded had a female founder. In the current batch, 23 percent of the companies that applied and that Y Combinator interviewed had a female founder. Twenty-two percent of the companies it ended up funding had a female founder.\r\n\r\nI’ve <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-culture-keeping-women-out-of-tech-jobs/\">written</a> about tech culture’s self-perpetuating diversity problem. One <a href=\"http://www.talentinnovation.org/_private/assets/Athena-2-ExecSummFINAL-CTI.pdf\">Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) report</a> found that although women make up a majority of science, engineering and technology majors, when it comes to the workplace, they feel “marginalized by lab-coat, hard-hat, and geek workplace cultures that are often exclusionary and promulgate bias.” About one-third of American women in these fields said they were likely to quit within a year.\r\n\r\nIf progress is going to be made along the lines pointed out in the CTI report, adjusting the culture is the first step. As my colleague Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nate-silver-talks-with-sheryl-sandberg/\">discussed</a> with Sheryl Sandberg earlier this month, men play an important role in improving gender equality, and the tech world is just one example of that:\r\n<div class=\"video-placeholder videoplayer loaded\" data-video-id=\"12428979\" data-cms=\"espn\" data-autostart=\"false\" data-related=\"true\" data-sharebuttons=\"true\" data-omniture-site-report=\"fivethirtyeight\" data-omniture-account=\"wdgespfivethirtyeight\"><object id=\"video-12428979\" class=\"OoyalaVideoPlayer\" data=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player_v2.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"515\" height=\"290\"></object></div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>CORRECTION (March 24, 8 a.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Y Combinator doesn’t currently track gender in its application process.','78 Percent Of Y Combinator Startups Have No Female Founders — And That’s Progress','','publish','open','open','','78-percent-of-y-combinator-startups-have-no-female-founders-and-thats-progress','','','2015-08-16 14:44:52','2015-08-16 14:44:52','',0,'http://hemdash.dev/?p=125',0,'post','',0),

Female representation in Y Combinator batches has grown, but seemingly not as much as the call for more diversity in tech.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t appear that Y Combinator is selecting more women than are applying. The incubator hasn’t asked applicants for their gender until this batch, but a random sample of the video applications from last summer’s batch showed that 24 percent of the startups that applied had a female founder, according to Y Combinator. In that batch, 20 percent of the startups that the company funded had a female founder. In the current batch, 23 percent of the companies that applied and that Y Combinator interviewed had a female founder. Twenty-two percent of the companies it ended up funding had a female founder.\r\n\r\nI’ve <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-culture-keeping-women-out-of-tech-jobs/\">written</a> about tech culture’s self-perpetuating diversity problem. One <a href=\"http://www.talentinnovation.org/_private/assets/Athena-2-ExecSummFINAL-CTI.pdf\">Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) report</a> found that although women make up a majority of science, engineering and technology majors, when it comes to the workplace, they feel “marginalized by lab-coat, hard-hat, and geek workplace cultures that are often exclusionary and promulgate bias.” About one-third of American women in these fields said they were likely to quit within a year.\r\n\r\nIf progress is going to be made along the lines pointed out in the CTI report, adjusting the culture is the first step. As my colleague Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nate-silver-talks-with-sheryl-sandberg/\">discussed</a> with Sheryl Sandberg earlier this month, men play an important role in improving gender equality, and the tech world is just one example of that:\r\n<div class=\"video-placeholder videoplayer loaded\" data-video-id=\"12428979\" data-cms=\"espn\" data-autostart=\"false\" data-related=\"true\" data-sharebuttons=\"true\" data-omniture-site-report=\"fivethirtyeight\" data-omniture-account=\"wdgespfivethirtyeight\"><object id=\"video-12428979\" class=\"OoyalaVideoPlayer\" data=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player_v2.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"515\" height=\"290\"></object></div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>CORRECTION (March 24, 8 a.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Y Combinator doesn’t currently track gender in its application process.','78 Percent Of Y Combinator Startups Have No Female Founders — And That’s Progress','','inherit','open','open','','125-revision-v1','','','2015-08-16 14:44:39','2015-08-16 14:44:39','',125,'http://hemdash.dev/125-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),
